Note [Canonicalization]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Canonicalization converts a simple constraint to a canonical form. It is
unary (i.e. treats individual constraints one at a time), does not do
any zonking, but lives in TcS monad because it needs to create fresh
variables (for flattening) and consult the inerts (for efficiency).

The execution plan for canonicalization is the following:

  1) Decomposition of equalities happens as necessary until we reach a
     variable or type family in one side. There is no decomposition step
     for other forms of constraints.

  2) If, when we decompose, we discover a variable on the head then we
     look at inert_eqs from the current inert for a substitution for this
     variable and continue decomposing. Hence we lazily apply the inert
     substitution if it is needed.

  3) If no more decomposition is possible, we deeply apply the substitution
     from the inert_eqs and continue with flattening.

  4) During flattening, we examine whether we have already flattened some
     function application by looking at all the CTyFunEqs with the same
     function in the inert set. The reason for deeply applying the inert
     substitution at step (3) is to maximise our chances of matching an
     already flattened family application in the inert.

The net result is that a constraint coming out of the canonicalization
phase cannot be rewritten any further from the inerts (but maybe /it/ can
rewrite an inert or still interact with an inert in a further phase in the
simplifier.

Note [Caching for canonicals]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Our plan with pre-canonicalization is to be able to solve a constraint
really fast from existing bindings in TcEvBinds. So one may think that
the condition (isCNonCanonical) is not necessary.  However consider
the following setup:

InertSet = { [W] d1 : Num t }
WorkList = { [W] d2 : Num t, [W] c : t ~ Int}

Now, we prioritize equalities, but in our concrete example
(should_run/mc17.hs) the first (d2) constraint is dealt with first,
because (t ~ Int) is an equality that only later appears in the
worklist since it is pulled out from a nested implication
constraint. So, let's examine what happens:

   - We encounter work item (d2 : Num t)

   - Nothing is yet in EvBinds, so we reach the interaction with inerts
     and set:
              d2 := d1
    and we discard d2 from the worklist. The inert set remains unaffected.

   - Now the equation ([W] c : t ~ Int) is encountered and kicks-out
     (d1 : Num t) from the inerts.  Then that equation gets
     spontaneously solved, perhaps. We end up with:
        InertSet : { [G] c : t ~ Int }
        WorkList : { [W] d1 : Num t}

   - Now we examine (d1), we observe that there is a binding for (Num
     t) in the evidence binds and we set:
             d1 := d2
     and end up in a loop!

Now, the constraints that get kicked out from the inert set are always
Canonical, so by restricting the use of the pre-canonicalizer to
NonCanonical constraints we eliminate this danger. Moreover, for
canonical constraints we already have good caching mechanisms
(effectively the interaction solver) and we are interested in reducing
things like superclasses of the same non-canonical constraint being
generated hence I don't expect us to lose a lot by introducing the
(isCNonCanonical) restriction.

A similar situation can arise in TcSimplify, at the end of the
solve_wanteds function, where constraints from the inert set are
returned as new work -- our substCt ensures however that if they are
not rewritten by subst, they remain canonical and hence we will not
attempt to solve them from the EvBinds. If on the other hand they did
get rewritten and are now non-canonical they will still not match the
EvBinds, so we are again good.

Note [Adding superclasses]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since dictionaries are canonicalized only once in their lifetime, the
place to add their superclasses is canonicalisation (The alternative
would be to do it during constraint solving, but we'd have to be
extremely careful to not repeatedly introduced the same superclass in
our worklist). Here is what we do:

For Givens:
       We add all their superclasses as Givens.

For Wanteds:
       Generally speaking we want to be able to add superclasses of
       wanteds for two reasons:

       (1) Opportunities for improvement. Example:
                  class (a ~ b) => C a b
           Wanted constraint is: C alpha beta
           We'd like to simply have C alpha alpha. Similar
           situations arise in relation to functional dependencies.

       (2) To have minimal constraints to quantify over:
           For instance, if our wanted constraint is (Eq a, Ord a)
           we'd only like to quantify over Ord a.

       To deal with (1) above we only add the superclasses of wanteds
       which may lead to improvement, that is: equality superclasses or
       superclasses with functional dependencies.

       We deal with (2) completely independently in TcSimplify. See
       Note [Minimize by SuperClasses] in TcSimplify.


       Moreover, in all cases the extra improvement constraints are
       Derived. Derived constraints have an identity (for now), but
       we don't do anything with their evidence. For instance they
       are never used to rewrite other constraints.

       See also [New Wanted Superclass Work] in TcInteract.


For Deriveds:
       We do nothing.

Here's an example that demonstrates why we chose to NOT add
superclasses during simplification: [Comes from ticket #4497]

   class Num (RealOf t) => Normed t
   type family RealOf x

Assume the generated wanted constraint is:
   RealOf e ~ e, Normed e
If we were to be adding the superclasses during simplification we'd get:
   Num uf, Normed e, RealOf e ~ e, RealOf e ~ uf
==>
   e ~ uf, Num uf, Normed e, RealOf e ~ e
==> [Spontaneous solve]
   Num uf, Normed uf, RealOf uf ~ uf

While looks exactly like our original constraint. If we add the superclass again we'd loop.
By adding superclasses definitely only once, during canonicalisation, this situation can't
happen.

Note [Eager reflexivity check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have

  newtype X = MkX (Int -> X)

and

  [W] X ~R X

Naively, we would start unwrapping X and end up in a loop. Instead,
we do this eager reflexivity check. This is necessary only for representational
equality because the flattener technology deals with the similar case
(recursive type families) for nominal equality.

As an alternative, suppose we also have

  newtype Y = MkY (Int -> Y)

and now wish to prove

  [W] X ~R Y

This new Wanted will loop, expanding out the newtypes ever deeper looking
for a solid match or a solid discrepancy. Indeed, there is something
appropriate to this looping, because X and Y *do* have the same representation,
in the limit -- they're both (Fix ((->) Int)). However, no finitely-sized
coercion will ever witness it. This loop won't actually cause GHC to hang,
though, because of the stack-blowing check in can_eq_newtype_nc, along
with the fact that rewriteEqEvidence bumps the stack depth.

Note [AppTy reflexivity check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider trying to prove (f a) ~R (f a). The AppTys in there can't
be decomposed, because representational equality isn't congruent with respect
to AppTy. So, when canonicalising the equality above, we get stuck and
would normally produce a CIrredEvCan. However, we really do want to
be able to solve (f a) ~R (f a). So, in the representational case only,
we do a reflexivity check.

(This would be sound in the nominal case, but unnecessary, and I [Richard
E.] am worried that it would slow down the common case.)

Note [Use canEqFailure in canDecomposableTyConApp]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We must use canEqFailure, not canEqHardFailure here, because there is
the possibility of success if working with a representational equality.
Here is the case:

  type family TF a where TF Char = Bool
  data family DF a
  newtype instance DF Bool = MkDF Int

Suppose we are canonicalising (Int ~R DF (T a)), where we don't yet
know `a`. This is *not* a hard failure, because we might soon learn
that `a` is, in fact, Char, and then the equality succeeds.

Note [Decomposing newtypes]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As explained in Note [NthCo and newtypes] in Coercion, we can't use
NthCo on representational coercions over newtypes. So we avoid doing
so.

But is it sensible to decompose *Wanted* constraints over newtypes?
Yes. By the time we reach canDecomposableTyConApp, we know that any
newtypes that can be unwrapped have been. So, without importing more
constructors, say, we know there is no way forward other than decomposition.
So we take the one route we have available. This *does* mean that
importing a newtype's constructor might make code that previously
compiled fail to do so. (If that newtype is perversely recursive, say.)

Note [Flatten irreducible representational equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we can't make any progress with a representational equality, but
we haven't given up all hope, we must flatten before producing the
CIrredEvCan. There are two reasons to do this:

  * See case in Note [Use canEqFailure in canDecomposableTyConApp].
    Flattening here can expose that we know enough information to unwrap
    a newtype.

  * This case, which was encountered in the testsuite (T9117_3):

      work item: [W] c1: f a ~R g a
      inert set: [G] c2: g ~R f

    In can_eq_app, we try to flatten the LHS of c1. This causes no effect,
    because `f` cannot be rewritten. So, we go to can_eq_flat_app. Without
    flattening the RHS, the reflexivity check fails, and we give up. However,
    flattening the RHS rewrites `g` to `f`, the reflexivity check succeeds,
    and we go on to glory.

Note [Decomposing TyConApps]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we see (T s1 t1 ~ T s2 t2), then we can just decompose to
  (s1 ~ s2, t1 ~ t2)
and push those back into the work list.  But if
  s1 = K k1    s2 = K k2
then we will jus decompose s1~s2, and it might be better to
do so on the spot.  An important special case is where s1=s2,
and we get just Refl.

So canDecomposableTyCon is a fast-path decomposition that uses
unifyWanted etc to short-cut that work.

Note [Canonicalising type applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given (s1 t1) ~ ty2, how should we proceed?
The simple things is to see if ty2 is of form (s2 t2), and
decompose.  By this time s1 and s2 can't be saturated type
function applications, because those have been dealt with
by an earlier equation in can_eq_nc, so it is always sound to
decompose.

However, over-eager decomposition gives bad error messages
for things like
   a b ~ Maybe c
   e f ~ p -> q
Suppose (in the first example) we already know a~Array.  Then if we
decompose the application eagerly, yielding
   a ~ Maybe
   b ~ c
we get an error        "Can't match Array ~ Maybe",
but we'd prefer to get "Can't match Array b ~ Maybe c".

So instead can_eq_wanted_app flattens the LHS and RHS, in the hope of
replacing (a b) by (Array b), before using try_decompose_app to
decompose it.

Note [Make sure that insolubles are fully rewritten]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When an equality fails, we still want to rewrite the equality
all the way down, so that it accurately reflects
 (a) the mutable reference substitution in force at start of solving
 (b) any ty-binds in force at this point in solving
See Note [Kick out insolubles] in TcInteract.
And if we don't do this there is a bad danger that
TcSimplify.applyTyVarDefaulting will find a variable
that has in fact been substituted.

Note [Do not decompose Given polytype equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider [G] (forall a. t1 ~ forall a. t2).  Can we decompose this?
No -- what would the evidence look like?  So instead we simply discard
this given evidence.


Note [Combining insoluble constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As this point we have an insoluble constraint, like Int~Bool.

 * If it is Wanted, delete it from the cache, so that subsequent
   Int~Bool constraints give rise to separate error messages

 * But if it is Derived, DO NOT delete from cache.  A class constraint
   may get kicked out of the inert set, and then have its functional
   dependency Derived constraints generated a second time. In that
   case we don't want to get two (or more) error messages by
   generating two (or more) insoluble fundep constraints from the same
   class constraint.

Note [No top-level newtypes on RHS of representational equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we're in this situation:

 work item:  [W] c1 : a ~R b
     inert:  [G] c2 : b ~R Id a

where
  newtype Id a = Id a

Further, suppose flattening `a` doesn't do anything. Then, we'll flatten the
RHS of c1 and have a new [W] c3 : a ~R Id a. If we just blindly proceed, we'll
fail in canEqTyVar2 with an occurs-check. What we really need to do is to
unwrap the `Id a` in the RHS. This is exactly analogous to the requirement for
no top-level type families on the RHS of a nominal equality. The only
annoyance is that the flattener doesn't do this work for us when flattening
the RHS, so we have to catch this case here and then go back to the beginning
of can_eq_nc. We know that this can't loop forever because we require that
flattening the RHS actually made progress. (If it didn't, then we really
*should* fail with an occurs-check!)

Note [Occurs check error]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we have an occurs check error, are we necessarily hosed? Say our
tyvar is tv1 and the type it appears in is xi2. Because xi2 is function
free, then if we're computing w.r.t. nominal equality, then, yes, we're
hosed. Nothing good can come from (a ~ [a]). If we're computing w.r.t.
representational equality, this is a little subtler. Once again, (a ~R [a])
is a bad thing, but (a ~R N a) for a newtype N might be just fine. This
means also that (a ~ b a) might be fine, because `b` might become a newtype.

So, we must check: does tv1 appear in xi2 under any type constructor that
is generative w.r.t. representational equality? That's what isTyVarUnderDatatype
does. (The other name I considered, isTyVarUnderTyConGenerativeWrtReprEq was
a bit verbose. And the shorter name gets the point across.)

Note [Canonical orientation for tyvar/tyvar equality constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we have a ~ b where both 'a' and 'b' are TcTyVars, which way
round should be oriented in the CTyEqCan?  The rules, implemented by
canEqTyVarTyVar, are these

 * If either is a flatten-meta-variables, it goes on the left.

 * If one is a strict sub-kind of the other e.g.
       (alpha::?) ~ (beta::*)
   orient them so RHS is a subkind of LHS.  That way we will replace
   'a' with 'b', correctly narrowing the kind.
   This establishes the subkind invariant of CTyEqCan.

 * Put a meta-tyvar on the left if possible
       alpha[3] ~ r

 * If both are meta-tyvars, put the more touchable one (deepest level
   number) on the left, so there is the best chance of unifying it
        alpha[3] ~ beta[2]

 * If both are meta-tyvars and both at the same level, put a SigTv
   on the right if possible
        alpha[2] ~ beta[2](sig-tv)
   That way, when we unify alpha := beta, we don't lose the SigTv flag.

 * Put a meta-tv with a System Name on the left if possible so it
   gets eliminated (improves error messages)

 * If one is a flatten-skolem, put it on the left so that it is
   substituted out  Note [Eliminate flat-skols]
        fsk ~ a

Note [Avoid unnecessary swaps]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we swap without actually improving matters, we can get an infinite loop.
Consider
    work item:  a ~ b
   inert item:  b ~ c
We canonicalise the work-time to (a ~ c).  If we then swap it before
aeding to the inert set, we'll add (c ~ a), and therefore kick out the
inert guy, so we get
   new work item:  b ~ c
   inert item:     c ~ a
And now the cycle just repeats

Note [Eliminate flat-skols]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have  [G] Num (F [a])
then we flatten to
     [G] Num fsk
     [G] F [a] ~ fsk
where fsk is a flatten-skolem (FlatSkol). Suppose we have
      type instance F [a] = a
then we'll reduce the second constraint to
     [G] a ~ fsk
and then replace all uses of 'a' with fsk.  That's bad because
in error messages intead of saying 'a' we'll say (F [a]).  In all
places, including those where the programmer wrote 'a' in the first
place.  Very confusing!  See Trac #7862.

Solution: re-orient a~fsk to fsk~a, so that we preferentially eliminate
the fsk.

Note [Equalities with incompatible kinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
canEqLeaf is about to make a CTyEqCan or CFunEqCan; but both have the
invariant that LHS and RHS satisfy the kind invariants for CTyEqCan,
CFunEqCan.  What if we try to unify two things with incompatible
kinds?

eg    a ~ b  where a::*, b::*->*
or    a ~ b  where a::*, b::k, k is a kind variable

The CTyEqCan compatKind invariant is important.  If we make a CTyEqCan
for a~b, then we might well *substitute* 'b' for 'a', and that might make
a well-kinded type ill-kinded; and that is bad (eg typeKind can crash, see
Trac #7696).

So instead for these ill-kinded equalities we generate a CIrredCan,
and put it in the inert set, which keeps it out of the way until a
subsequent substitution (on kind variables, say) re-activates it.

NB: it is important that the types s1,s2 are flattened and zonked
    so that their kinds k1, k2 are inert wrt the substitution.  That
    means that they can only become the same if we change the inert
    set, which in turn will kick out the irreducible equality
    E.g. it is WRONG to make an irred (a:k1)~(b:k2)
         if we already have a substitution k1:=k2

NB: it's important that the new CIrredCan goes in the inert set rather
than back into the work list. We used to do the latter, but that led
to an infinite loop when we encountered it again, and put it back in
the work list again.

See also Note [Kind orientation for CTyEqCan] and
         Note [Kind orientation for CFunEqCan] in TcRnTypes

Note [Type synonyms and canonicalization]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We treat type synonym applications as xi types, that is, they do not
count as type function applications.  However, we do need to be a bit
careful with type synonyms: like type functions they may not be
generative or injective.  However, unlike type functions, they are
parametric, so there is no problem in expanding them whenever we see
them, since we do not need to know anything about their arguments in
order to expand them; this is what justifies not having to treat them
as specially as type function applications.  The thing that causes
some subtleties is that we prefer to leave type synonym applications
*unexpanded* whenever possible, in order to generate better error
messages.

If we encounter an equality constraint with type synonym applications
on both sides, or a type synonym application on one side and some sort
of type application on the other, we simply must expand out the type
synonyms in order to continue decomposing the equality constraint into
primitive equality constraints.  For example, suppose we have

  type F a = [Int]

and we encounter the equality

  F a ~ [b]

In order to continue we must expand F a into [Int], giving us the
equality

  [Int] ~ [b]

which we can then decompose into the more primitive equality
constraint

  Int ~ b.

However, if we encounter an equality constraint with a type synonym
application on one side and a variable on the other side, we should
NOT (necessarily) expand the type synonym, since for the purpose of
good error messages we want to leave type synonyms unexpanded as much
as possible.  Hence the ps_ty1, ps_ty2 argument passed to canEqTyVar.


Note [occurCheckExpand]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a subtle point with type synonyms and the occurs check that
takes place for equality constraints of the form tv ~ xi.  As an
example, suppose we have

  type F a = Int

and we come across the equality constraint

  a ~ F a

This should not actually fail the occurs check, since expanding out
the type synonym results in the legitimate equality constraint a ~
Int.  We must actually do this expansion, because unifying a with F a
will lead the type checker into infinite loops later.  Put another
way, canonical equality constraints should never *syntactically*
contain the LHS variable in the RHS type.  However, we don't always
need to expand type synonyms when doing an occurs check; for example,
the constraint

  a ~ F b

is obviously fine no matter what F expands to. And in this case we
would rather unify a with F b (rather than F b's expansion) in order
to get better error messages later.

So, when doing an occurs check with a type synonym application on the
RHS, we use some heuristics to find an expansion of the RHS which does
not contain the variable from the LHS.  In particular, given

  a ~ F t1 ... tn

we first try expanding each of the ti to types which no longer contain
a.  If this turns out to be impossible, we next try expanding F
itself, and so on.  See Note [Occurs check expansion] in TcType

Note [xCtEvidence]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A call might look like this:

    xCtEvidence ev evidence-transformer

  ev is Given   => use ev_decomp to create new Givens for ev_preds,
                   and return them

  ev is Wanted  => create new wanteds for ev_preds,
                   use ev_comp to bind ev,
                   return fresh wanteds (ie ones not cached in inert_cans or solved)

  ev is Derived => create new deriveds for ev_preds
                      (unless cached in inert_cans or solved)

Note: The [CtEvidence] returned is a subset of the subgoal-preds passed in
      Ones that are already cached are not returned

Example
    ev : Tree a b ~ Tree c d
    xCtEvidence ev [a~c, b~d] (XEvTerm { ev_comp = \[c1 c2]. <Tree> c1 c2
                                       , ev_decomp = \c. [nth 1 c, nth 2 c] })
              (\fresh-goals.  stuff)

Note [Bind new Givens immediately]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For Givens we make new EvVars and bind them immediately. We don't worry
about caching, but we don't expect complicated calculations among Givens.
It is important to bind each given:
      class (a~b) => C a b where ....
      f :: C a b => ....
Then in f's Givens we have g:(C a b) and the superclass sc(g,0):a~b.
But that superclass selector can't (yet) appear in a coercion
(see evTermCoercion), so the easy thing is to bind it to an Id.

Note [Rewriting with Refl]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the coercion is just reflexivity then you may re-use the same
variable.  But be careful!  Although the coercion is Refl, new_pred
may reflect the result of unification alpha := ty, so new_pred might
not _look_ the same as old_pred, and it's vital to proceed from now on
using new_pred.

The flattener preserves type synonyms, so they should appear in new_pred
as well as in old_pred; that is important for good error messages.

{- Note [unifyWanted and unifyDerived]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When decomposing equalities we often create new wanted constraints for
(s ~ t).  But what if s=t?  Then it'd be faster to return Refl right away.
Similar remarks apply for Derived.

Rather than making an equality test (which traverses the structure of the
type, perhaps fruitlessly, unifyWanted traverses the common structure, and
bales out when it finds a difference by creating a new Wanted constraint.
But where it succeeds in finding common structure, it just builds a coercion
to reflect it.
