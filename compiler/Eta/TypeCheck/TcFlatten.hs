Note [The flattening story]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* A CFunEqCan is either of form
     [G] <F xis> : F xis ~ fsk   -- fsk is a FlatSkol
     [W]       x : F xis ~ fmv   -- fmv is a unification variable,
                                 -- but untouchable,
                                 -- with MetaInfo = FlatMetaTv
  where
     x is the witness variable
     fsk/fmv is a flatten skolem
     xis are function-free
  CFunEqCans are always [Wanted], or [Given], never [Derived]

  fmv untouchable just means that in a CTyVarEq, say,
       fmv ~ Int
  we do NOT unify fmv.

* KEY INSIGHTS:

   - A given flatten-skolem, fsk, is known a-priori to be equal to
     F xis (the LHS), with <F xis> evidence

   - A unification flatten-skolem, fmv, stands for the as-yet-unknown
     type to which (F xis) will eventually reduce

* Inert set invariant: if F xis1 ~ fsk1, F xis2 ~ fsk2
                       then xis1 /= xis2
  i.e. at most one CFunEqCan with a particular LHS

* Each canonical CFunEqCan x : F xis ~ fsk/fmv has its own
  distinct evidence variable x and flatten-skolem fsk/fmv.
  Why? We make a fresh fsk/fmv when the constraint is born;
  and we never rewrite the RHS of a CFunEqCan.

* Function applications can occur in the RHS of a CTyEqCan.  No reason
  not allow this, and it reduces the amount of flattening that must occur.

* Flattening a type (F xis):
    - If we are flattening in a Wanted/Derived constraint
      then create new [W] x : F xis ~ fmv
      else create new [G] x : F xis ~ fsk
      with fresh evidence variable x and flatten-skolem fsk/fmv

    - Add it to the work list

    - Replace (F xis) with fsk/fmv in the type you are flattening

    - You can also add the CFunEqCan to the "flat cache", which
      simply keeps track of all the function applications you
      have flattened.

    - If (F xis) is in the cache already, just
      use its fsk/fmv and evidence x, and emit nothing.

    - No need to substitute in the flat-cache. It's not the end
      of the world if we start with, say (F alpha ~ fmv1) and
      (F Int ~ fmv2) and then find alpha := Int.  Athat will
      simply give rise to fmv1 := fmv2 via [Interacting rule] below

* Canonicalising a CFunEqCan [G/W] x : F xis ~ fsk/fmv
    - Flatten xis (to substitute any tyvars; there are already no functions)
                  cos :: xis ~ flat_xis
    - New wanted  x2 :: F flat_xis ~ fsk/fmv
    - Add new wanted to flat cache
    - Discharge x = F cos ; x2

* Unification flatten-skolems, fmv, ONLY get unified when either
    a) The CFunEqCan takes a step, using an axiom
    b) During un-flattening
  They are never unified in any other form of equality.
  For example [W] ffmv ~ Int  is stuck; it does not unify with fmv.

* We *never* substitute in the RHS (i.e. the fsk/fmv) of a CFunEqCan.
  That would destroy the invariant about the shape of a CFunEqCan,
  and it would risk wanted/wanted interactions. The only way we
  learn information about fsk is when the CFunEqCan takes a step.

  However we *do* substitute in the LHS of a CFunEqCan (else it
  would never get to fire!)

* [Interacting rule]
    (inert)     [W] x1 : F tys ~ fmv1
    (work item) [W] x2 : F tys ~ fmv2
  Just solve one from the other:
    x2 := x1
    fmv2 := fmv1
  This just unites the two fsks into one.
  Always solve given from wanted if poss.

* [Firing rule: wanteds]
    (work item) [W] x : F tys ~ fmv
    instantiate axiom: ax_co : F tys ~ rhs

   Dischard fmv:
      fmv := alpha
      x := ax_co ; sym x2
      [W] x2 : alpha ~ rhs  (Non-canonical)
   discharging the work item. This is the way that fmv's get
   unified; even though they are "untouchable".

   NB: this deals with the case where fmv appears in xi, which can
   happen; it just happens through the non-canonical stuff

   Possible short cut (shortCutReduction) if rhs = G rhs_tys,
   where G is a type function.  Then
      - Flatten rhs_tys (cos : rhs_tys ~ rhs_xis)
      - Add G rhs_xis ~ fmv to flat cache
      - New wanted [W] x2 : G rhs_xis ~ fmv
      - Discharge x := co ; G cos ; x2

* [Firing rule: givens]
    (work item) [G] g : F tys ~ fsk
    instantiate axiom: co : F tys ~ rhs

   Now add non-canonical (since rhs is not flat)
      [G] (sym g ; co) : fsk ~ rhs

   Short cut (shortCutReduction) for when rhs = G rhs_tys and G is a type function
      [G] (co ; g) : G tys ~ fsk
   But need to flatten tys:  flat_cos : tys ~ flat_tys
      [G] (sym (G flat_cos) ; co ; g) : G flat_tys ~ fsk


Why given-fsks, alone, doesn't work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Could we get away with only flatten meta-tyvars, with no flatten-skolems? No.

  [W] w : alpha ~ [F alpha Int]

---> flatten
  w = ...w'...
  [W] w' : alpha ~ [fsk]
  [G] <F alpha Int> : F alpha Int ~ fsk

--> unify (no occurs check)
  alpha := [fsk]

But since fsk = F alpha Int, this is really an occurs check error.  If
that is all we know about alpha, we will succeed in constraint
solving, producing a program with an infinite type.

Even if we did finally get (g : fsk ~ Boo)l by solving (F alpha Int ~ fsk)
using axiom, zonking would not see it, so (x::alpha) sitting in the
tree will get zonked to an infinite type.  (Zonking always only does
refl stuff.)

Why flatten-meta-vars, alone doesn't work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Look at Simple13, with unification-fmvs only

  [G] g : a ~ [F a]

---> Flatten given
  g' = g;[x]
  [G] g'  : a ~ [fmv]
  [W] x : F a ~ fmv

--> subst a in x
       x = F g' ; x2
   [W] x2 : F [fmv] ~ fmv

And now we have an evidence cycle between g' and x!

If we used a given instead (ie current story)

  [G] g : a ~ [F a]

---> Flatten given
  g' = g;[x]
  [G] g'  : a ~ [fsk]
  [G] <F a> : F a ~ fsk

---> Substitute for a
  [G] g'  : a ~ [fsk]
  [G] F (sym g'); <F a> : F [fsk] ~ fsk


Why is it right to treat fmv's differently to ordinary unification vars?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  f :: forall a. a -> a -> Bool
  g :: F Int -> F Int -> Bool

Consider
  f (x:Int) (y:Bool)
This gives alpha~Int, alpha~Bool.  There is an inconsistency,
but really only one error.  SherLoc may tell you which location
is most likely, based on other occurrences of alpha.

Consider
  g (x:Int) (y:Bool)
Here we get (F Int ~ Int, F Int ~ Bool), which flattens to
  (fmv ~ Int, fmv ~ Bool)
But there are really TWO separate errors.  We must not complain
about Int~Bool.  Moreover these two errors could arise in entirely
unrelated parts of the code.  (In the alpha case, there must be
*some* connection (eg v:alpha in common envt).)

Note [Orient equalities with flatten-meta-vars on the left]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example comes from IndTypesPerfMerge

From the ambiguity check for
  f :: (F a ~ a) => a
we get:
      [G] F a ~ a
      [W] F alpha ~ alpha, alpha ~ a

    From Givens we get
      [G] F a ~ fsk, fsk ~ a

    Now if we flatten we get
      [W] alpha ~ fmv, F alpha ~ fmv, alpha ~ a

    Now, processing the first one first, choosing alpha := fmv
      [W] F fmv ~ fmv, fmv ~ a

    And now we are stuck.  We must either *unify* fmv := a, or
    use the fmv ~ a to rewrite F fmv ~ fmv, so we can make it
    meet up with the given F a ~ blah.

Solution: always put fmvs on the left, so we get
      [W] fmv ~ alpha, F alpha ~ fmv, alpha ~ a
  The point is that fmvs are very uninformative, so doing alpha := fmv
  is a bad idea.  We want to use other constraints on alpha first.


Note [Derived constraints from wanted CTyEqCans]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Is this type ambiguous:  (Foo e ~ Maybe e) => Foo e
 (indexed-types/should_fail/T4093a)

 [G] Foo e ~ Maybe e
 [W] Foo e ~ Foo ee      -- ee is a unification variable
 [W] Foo ee ~ Maybe ee)
---
 [G] Foo e ~ fsk
 [G] fsk ~ Maybe e

 [W] Foo e ~ fmv1
 [W] Foo ee ~ fmv2
 [W] fmv1 ~ fmv2
 [W] fmv2 ~ Maybe ee

--->   fmv1 := fsk  by matching LHSs
 [W] Foo ee ~ fmv2
 [W] fsk ~ fmv2
 [W] fmv2 ~ Maybe ee

--->
 [W] Foo ee ~ fmv2
 [W] fmv2 ~ Maybe e
 [W] fmv2 ~ Maybe ee

Now maybe we should get [D] e ~ ee, and then we'd solve it entirely.
But if in a similar situation we got [D] Int ~ Bool we'd be back
to complaining about wanted/wanted interactions.  Maybe this arises
also for fundeps?

Here's another example:
  f :: [a] -> [b] -> blah
  f (e1 :: F Int) (e2 :: F Int)

  we get
     F Int ~ fmv
     fmv ~ [alpha]
     fmv ~ [beta]

  We want: alpha := beta (which might unlock something else).  If we
  generated [D] [alpha] ~ [beta] we'd be good here.

Current story: we don't generate these derived constraints.  We could, but
we'd want to make them very weak, so we didn't get the Int~Bool complaint.

Try: rewrite wanted with wanted only for fmvs (not all meta-tyvars)

But:   fmv ~ alpha[0]
       alpha[0] ~ fmv’
Now we don’t see that fmv ~ fmv’, which is a problem for injectivity detection.

Conclusion: rewrite wanteds with wanted for all untouchables.

skol ~ untch, must re-orient to untch ~ skol, so that we can use it to rewrite.

----------------------------------------
indexed_types/should_fail/T8227:

Why using a different can-rewrite rule in CFunEqCan heads
does not work.

Assuming NOT rewriting wanteds with wanteds

   Inert: [W] fsk_aBh ~ fmv_aBk -> fmv_aBk
          [W] fmv_aBk ~ fsk_aBh

          [G] Scalar fsk_aBg ~ fsk_aBh
          [G] V a ~ f_aBg

   Worklist includes  [W] Scalar fmv_aBi ~ fmv_aBk
   fmv_aBi, fmv_aBk are flatten unification variables

   Work item: [W] V fsk_aBh ~ fmv_aBi

Note that the inert wanteds are cyclic, because we do not rewrite
wanteds with wanteds.


Then we go into a loop when normalise the work-item, because we
use rewriteOrSame on the argument of V.

Conclusion: Don't make canRewrite context specific; instead use
[W] a ~ ty to rewrite a wanted iff 'a' is a unification variable.


----------------------------------------

Here is a somewhat similar case:

   type family G a :: *

   blah :: (G a ~ Bool, Eq (G a)) => a -> a
   blah = error "urk"

   foo x = blah x

For foo we get
   [W] Eq (G a), G a ~ Bool
Flattening
   [W] G a ~ fmv, Eq fmv, fmv ~ Bool
We can't simplify away the Eq Bool unless we substitute for fmv.
Maybe that doesn't matter: we would still be left with unsolved
G a ~ Bool.

--------------------------
Trac #9318 has a very simple program leading to

  [W] F Int ~ Int
  [W] F Int ~ Bool

We don't want to get "Error Int~Bool".  But if fmv's can rewrite
wanteds, we will

  [W] fmv ~ Int
  [W] fmv ~ Bool
--->
  [W] Int ~ Bool

Note [Flattening]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  flatten ty  ==>   (xi, cc)
    where
      xi has no type functions, unless they appear under ForAlls

      cc = Auxiliary given (equality) constraints constraining
           the fresh type variables in xi.  Evidence for these
           is always the identity coercion, because internally the
           fresh flattening skolem variables are actually identified
           with the types they have been generated to stand in for.

Note that it is flatten's job to flatten *every type function it sees*.
flatten is only called on *arguments* to type functions, by canEqGiven.

Recall that in comments we use alpha[flat = ty] to represent a
flattening skolem variable alpha which has been generated to stand in
for ty.

----- Example of flattening a constraint: ------
  flatten (List (F (G Int)))  ==>  (xi, cc)
    where
      xi  = List alpha
      cc  = { G Int ~ beta[flat = G Int],
              F beta ~ alpha[flat = F beta] }
Here
  * alpha and beta are 'flattening skolem variables'.
  * All the constraints in cc are 'given', and all their coercion terms
    are the identity.

NB: Flattening Skolems only occur in canonical constraints, which
are never zonked, so we don't need to worry about zonking doing
accidental unflattening.

Note that we prefer to leave type synonyms unexpanded when possible,
so when the flattener encounters one, it first asks whether its
transitive expansion contains any type function applications.  If so,
it expands the synonym and proceeds; if not, it simply returns the
unexpanded synonym.

Note [Flattener EqRels]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When flattening, we need to know which equality relation -- nominal
or representation -- we should be respecting. The only difference is
that we rewrite variables by representational equalities when fe_eq_rel
is ReprEq.

Note [Lazy flattening]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The idea of FM_Avoid mode is to flatten less aggressively.  If we have
       a ~ [F Int]
there seems to be no great merit in lifting out (F Int).  But if it was
       a ~ [G a Int]
then we *do* want to lift it out, in case (G a Int) reduces to Bool, say,
which gets rid of the occurs-check problem.  (For the flat_top Bool, see
comments above and at call sites.)

HOWEVER, the lazy flattening actually seems to make type inference go
*slower*, not faster.  perf/compiler/T3064 is a case in point; it gets
*dramatically* worse with FM_Avoid.  I think it may be because
floating the types out means we normalise them, and that often makes
them smaller and perhaps allows more re-use of previously solved
goals.  But to be honest I'm not absolutely certain, so I am leaving
FM_Avoid in the code base.  What I'm removing is the unique place
where it is *used*, namely in TcCanonical.canEqTyVar.

See also Note [Conservative unification check] in TcUnify, which gives
other examples where lazy flattening caused problems.

Bottom line: FM_Avoid is unused for now (Nov 14).
Note: T5321Fun got faster when I disabled FM_Avoid
      T5837 did too, but it's pathological anyway

Note [Phantoms in the flattener]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have

data Proxy p = Proxy

and we're flattening (Proxy ty) w.r.t. ReprEq. Then, we know that `ty`
is really irrelevant -- it will be ignored when solving for representational
equality later on. So, we omit flattening `ty` entirely. This may
violate the expectation of "xi"s for a bit, but the canonicaliser will
soon throw out the phantoms when decomposing a TyConApp. (Or, the
canonicaliser will emit an insoluble, in which case the unflattened version
yields a better error message anyway.)

Note [flatten_many performance]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In programs with lots of type-level evaluation, flatten_many becomes
part of a tight loop. For example, see test perf/compiler/T9872a, which
calls flatten_many a whopping 7,106,808 times. It is thus important
that flatten_many be efficient.

Performance testing showed that the current implementation is indeed
efficient. It's critically important that zipWithAndUnzipM be
specialized to TcS, and it's also quite helpful to actually `inline`
it. On test T9872a, here are the allocation stats (Dec 16, 2014):

 * Unspecialized, uninlined:     8,472,613,440 bytes allocated in the heap
 * Specialized, uninlined:       6,639,253,488 bytes allocated in the heap
 * Specialized, inlined:         6,281,539,792 bytes allocated in the heap

To improve performance even further, flatten_many_nom is split off
from flatten_many, as nominal equality is the common case. This would
be natural to write using mapAndUnzipM, but even inlined, that function
is not as performant as a hand-written loop.

 * mapAndUnzipM, inlined:        7,463,047,432 bytes allocated in the heap
 * hand-written recursion:       5,848,602,848 bytes allocated in the heap

If you make any change here, pay close attention to the T9872{a,b,c} tests
and T5321Fun.

If we need to make this yet more performant, a possible way forward is to
duplicate the flattener code for the nominal case, and make that case
faster. This doesn't seem quite worth it, yet.

Note [Flattening synonyms]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not expanding synonyms aggressively improves error messages, and
keeps types smaller. But we need to take care.

Suppose
   type T a = a -> a
and we want to flatten the type (T (F a)).  Then we can safely flatten
the (F a) to a skolem, and return (T fsk).  We don't need to expand the
synonym.  This works because TcTyConAppCo can deal with synonyms
(unlike TyConAppCo), see Note [TcCoercions] in TcEvidence.

But (Trac #8979) for
   type T a = (F a, a)    where F is a type function
we must expand the synonym in (say) T Int, to expose the type function
to the flattener.


Note [Flattening under a forall]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Under a forall, we
  (a) MUST apply the inert substitution
  (b) MUST NOT flatten type family applications
Hence FMSubstOnly.

For (a) consider   c ~ a, a ~ T (forall b. (b, [c]))
If we don't apply the c~a substitution to the second constraint
we won't see the occurs-check error.

For (b) consider  (a ~ forall b. F a b), we don't want to flatten
to     (a ~ forall b.fsk, F a b ~ fsk)
because now the 'b' has escaped its scope.  We'd have to flatten to
       (a ~ forall b. fsk b, forall b. F a b ~ fsk b)
and we have not begun to think about how to make that work!

{- Note [Reduce type family applications eagerly]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we come across a type-family application like (Append (Cons x Nil) t),
then, rather than flattening to a skolem etc, we may as well just reduce
it on the spot to (Cons x t).  This saves a lot of intermediate steps.
Examples that are helped are tests T9872, and T5321Fun.

Performance testing indicates that it's best to try this *twice*, once
before flattening arguments and once after flattening arguments.
Adding the extra reduction attempt before flattening arguments cut
the allocation amounts for the T9872{a,b,c} tests by half. Testing
also indicated that the early reduction should not use the flat-cache,
but that the later reduction should. It's possible that with more
examples, we might learn that these knobs should be set differently.

Once we've got a flat rhs, we extend the flatten-cache to record the
result.  Doing so can save lots of work when the same redex shows up
more than once.  Note that we record the link from the redex all the
way to its *final* value, not just the single step reduction.

Note [The inert equalities]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Definition [Can-rewrite relation]
A "can-rewrite" relation between flavours, written f1 >= f2, is a
binary relation with the following properties

  R1.  >= is transitive
  R2.  If f1 >= f, and f2 >= f,
       then either f1 >= f2 or f2 >= f1

Lemma.  If f1 >= f then f1 >= f1
Proof.  By property (R2), with f1=f2

Definition [Generalised substitution]
A "generalised substitution" S is a set of triples (a -f-> t), where
  a is a type variable
  t is a type
  f is a flavour
such that
  (WF1) if (a -f1-> t1) in S
           (a -f2-> t2) in S
        then neither (f1 >= f2) nor (f2 >= f1) hold
  (WF2) if (a -f-> t) is in S, then t /= a

Definition [Applying a generalised substitution]
If S is a generalised substitution
   S(f,a) = t,  if (a -fs-> t) in S, and fs >= f
          = a,  otherwise
Application extends naturally to types S(f,t), modulo roles.
See Note [Flavours with roles].

Theorem: S(f,a) is well defined as a function.
Proof: Suppose (a -f1-> t1) and (a -f2-> t2) are both in S,
               and  f1 >= f and f2 >= f
       Then by (R2) f1 >= f2 or f2 >= f1, which contradicts (WF)

Notation: repeated application.
  S^0(f,t)     = t
  S^(n+1)(f,t) = S(f, S^n(t))

Definition: inert generalised substitution
A generalised substitution S is "inert" iff

  (IG1) there is an n such that
        for every f,t, S^n(f,t) = S^(n+1)(f,t)

  (IG2) if (b -f-> t) in S, and f >= f, then S(f,t) = t
        that is, each individual binding is "self-stable"

----------------------------------------------------------------
Our main invariant:
   the inert CTyEqCans should be an inert generalised substitution
----------------------------------------------------------------

Note that inertness is not the same as idempotence.  To apply S to a
type, you may have to apply it recursive.  But inertness does
guarantee that this recursive use will terminate.

---------- The main theorem --------------
   Suppose we have a "work item"
       a -fw-> t
   and an inert generalised substitution S,
   such that
      (T1) S(fw,a) = a     -- LHS of work-item is a fixpoint of S(fw,_)
      (T2) S(fw,t) = t     -- RHS of work-item is a fixpoint of S(fw,_)
      (T3) a not in t      -- No occurs check in the work item

      (K1) if (a -fs-> s) is in S then not (fw >= fs)
      (K2) if (b -fs-> s) is in S, where b /= a, then
              (K2a) not (fs >= fs)
           or (K2b) not (fw >= fs)
           or (K2c) a not in s
      (K3) If (b -fs-> s) is in S with (fw >= fs), then
        (K3a) If the role of fs is nominal: s /= a
        (K3b) If the role of fs is representational: EITHER
                a not in s, OR
                the path from the top of s to a includes at least one non-newtype

   then the extended substitution T = S+(a -fw-> t)
   is an inert generalised substitution.

The idea is that
* (T1-2) are guaranteed by exhaustively rewriting the work-item
  with S(fw,_).

* T3 is guaranteed by a simple occurs-check on the work item.

* (K1-3) are the "kick-out" criteria.  (As stated, they are really the
  "keep" criteria.) If the current inert S contains a triple that does
  not satisfy (K1-3), then we remove it from S by "kicking it out",
  and re-processing it.

* Note that kicking out is a Bad Thing, because it means we have to
  re-process a constraint.  The less we kick out, the better.
  TODO: Make sure that kicking out really *is* a Bad Thing. We've assumed
  this but haven't done the empirical study to check.

* Assume we have  G>=G, G>=W, D>=D, and that's all.  Then, when performing
  a unification we add a new given  a -G-> ty.  But doing so does NOT require
  us to kick out an inert wanted that mentions a, because of (K2a).  This
  is a common case, hence good not to kick out.

* Lemma (L1): The conditions of the Main Theorem imply that there is no
              (a fs-> t) in S, s.t.  (fs >= fw).
  Proof. Suppose the contrary (fs >= fw).  Then because of (T1),
  S(fw,a)=a.  But since fs>=fw, S(fw,a) = s, hence s=a.  But now we
  have (a -fs-> a) in S, which contradicts (WF2).

* The extended substitution satisfies (WF1) and (WF2)
  - (K1) plus (L1) guarantee that the extended substitution satisfies (WF1).
  - (T3) guarantees (WF2).

* (K2) is about inertness.  Intuitively, any infinite chain T^0(f,t),
  T^1(f,t), T^2(f,T).... must pass through the new work item infinitely
  often, since the substitution without the work item is inert; and must
  pass through at least one of the triples in S infinitely often.

  - (K2a): if not(fs>=fs) then there is no f that fs can rewrite (fs>=f),
    and hence this triple never plays a role in application S(f,a).
    It is always safe to extend S with such a triple.

    (NB: we could strengthen K1) in this way too, but see K3.

  - (K2b): If this holds, we can't pass through this triple infinitely
    often, because if we did then fs>=f, fw>=f, hence fs>=fw,
    contradicting (L1), or fw>=fs contradicting K2b.

  - (K2c): if a not in s, we hae no further opportunity to apply the
    work item.

  NB: this reasoning isn't water tight.

Key lemma to make it watertight.
  Under the conditions of the Main Theorem,
  forall f st fw >= f, a is not in S^k(f,t), for any k

Also, consider roles more carefully. See Note [Flavours with roles].

Completeness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
K3: completeness.  (K3) is not necessary for the extended substitution
to be inert.  In fact K1 could be made stronger by saying
   ... then (not (fw >= fs) or not (fs >= fs))
But it's not enough for S to be inert; we also want completeness.
That is, we want to be able to solve all soluble wanted equalities.
Suppose we have

   work-item   b -G-> a
   inert-item  a -W-> b

Assuming (G >= W) but not (W >= W), this fulfills all the conditions,
so we could extend the inerts, thus:

   inert-items   b -G-> a
                 a -W-> b

But if we kicked-out the inert item, we'd get

   work-item     a -W-> b
   inert-item    b -G-> a

Then rewrite the work-item gives us (a -W-> a), which is soluble via Refl.
So we add one more clause to the kick-out criteria

Another way to understand (K3) is that we treat an inert item
        a -f-> b
in the same way as
        b -f-> a
So if we kick out one, we should kick out the other.  The orientation
is somewhat accidental.

When considering roles, we also need the second clause (K3b). Consider

  inert-item   a -W/R-> b c
  work-item    c -G/N-> a

The work-item doesn't get rewritten by the inert, because (>=) doesn't hold.
We've satisfied conditions (T1)-(T3) and (K1) and (K2). If all we had were
condition (K3a), then we would keep the inert around and add the work item.
But then, consider if we hit the following:

  work-item2   b -G/N-> Id

where

  newtype Id x = Id x

For similar reasons, if we only had (K3a), we wouldn't kick the
representational inert out. And then, we'd miss solving the inert, which
now reduced to reflexivity. The solution here is to kick out representational
inerts whenever the tyvar of a work item is "exposed", where exposed means
not under some proper data-type constructor, like [] or Maybe. See
isTyVarExposed in TcType. This is encoded in (K3b).

Note [Flavours with roles]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The system described in Note [The inert equalities] discusses an abstract
set of flavours. In GHC, flavours have two components: the flavour proper,
taken from {Wanted, Derived, Given}; and the equality relation (often called
role), taken from {NomEq, ReprEq}. When substituting w.r.t. the inert set,
as described in Note [The inert equalities], we must be careful to respect
roles. For example, if we have

  inert set: a -G/R-> Int
             b -G/R-> Bool

  type role T nominal representational

and we wish to compute S(W/R, T a b), the correct answer is T a Bool, NOT
T Int Bool. The reason is that T's first parameter has a nominal role, and
thus rewriting a to Int in T a b is wrong. Indeed, this non-congruence of
substitution means that the proof in Note [The inert equalities] may need
to be revisited, but we don't think that the end conclusion is wrong.

Note [An alternative story for the inert substitution]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(This entire note is just background, left here in case we ever want
 to return the previously state of affairs)

We used (GHC 7.8) to have this story for the inert substitution inert_eqs

 * 'a' is not in fvs(ty)
 * They are *inert* in the weaker sense that there is no infinite chain of
   (i1 `eqCanRewrite` i2), (i2 `eqCanRewrite` i3), etc

This means that flattening must be recursive, but it does allow
  [G] a ~ [b]
  [G] b ~ Maybe c

This avoids "saturating" the Givens, which can save a modest amount of work.
It is easy to implement, in TcInteract.kick_out, by only kicking out an inert
only if (a) the work item can rewrite the inert AND
        (b) the inert cannot rewrite the work item

This is significantly harder to think about. It can save a LOT of work
in occurs-check cases, but we don't care about them much.  Trac #5837
is an example; all the constraints here are Givens

             [G] a ~ TF (a,Int)
    -->
    work     TF (a,Int) ~ fsk
    inert    fsk ~ a

    --->
    work     fsk ~ (TF a, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ a

    --->
    work     a ~ (TF a, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ a

    ---> (attempting to flatten (TF a) so that it does not mention a
    work     TF a ~ fsk2
    inert    a ~ (fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ (fsk2, TF Int)

    ---> (substitute for a)
    work     TF (fsk2, TF Int) ~ fsk2
    inert    a ~ (fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ (fsk2, TF Int)

    ---> (top-level reduction, re-orient)
    work     fsk2 ~ (TF fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    a ~ (fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ (fsk2, TF Int)

    ---> (attempt to flatten (TF fsk2) to get rid of fsk2
    work     TF fsk2 ~ fsk3
    work     fsk2 ~ (fsk3, TF Int)
    inert    a   ~ (fsk2, TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ (fsk2, TF Int)

    --->
    work     TF fsk2 ~ fsk3
    inert    fsk2 ~ (fsk3, TF Int)
    inert    a   ~ ((fsk3, TF Int), TF Int)
    inert    fsk ~ ((fsk3, TF Int), TF Int)

Because the incoming given rewrites all the inert givens, we get more and
more duplication in the inert set.  But this really only happens in pathological
casee, so we don't care.

Note [eqCanRewrite]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(eqCanRewrite ct1 ct2) holds if the constraint ct1 (a CTyEqCan of form
tv ~ ty) can be used to rewrite ct2.  It must satisfy the properties of
a can-rewrite relation, see Definition [Can-rewrite relation]

At the moment we don't allow Wanteds to rewrite Wanteds, because that can give
rise to very confusing type error messages.  A good example is Trac #8450.
Here's another
   f :: a -> Bool
   f x = ( [x,'c'], [x,True] ) `seq` True
Here we get
  [W] a ~ Char
  [W] a ~ Bool
but we do not want to complain about Bool ~ Char!

Accordingly, we also don't let Deriveds rewrite Deriveds.

With the solver handling Coercible constraints like equality constraints,
the rewrite conditions must take role into account, never allowing
a representational equality to rewrite a nominal one.

Note [canRewriteOrSame]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
canRewriteOrSame is similar but
 * returns True for Wanted/Wanted.
 * works for all kinds of constraints, not just CTyEqCans
