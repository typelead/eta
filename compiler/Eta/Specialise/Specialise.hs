************************************************************************

These notes describe how we implement specialisation to eliminate
overloading.

The specialisation pass works on Core
syntax, complete with all the explicit dictionary application,
abstraction and construction as added by the type checker.  The
existing type checker remains largely as it is.

One important thought: the {\em types} passed to an overloaded
function, and the {\em dictionaries} passed are mutually redundant.
If the same function is applied to the same type(s) then it is sure to
be applied to the same dictionary(s)---or rather to the same {\em
values}.  (The arguments might look different but they will evaluate
to the same value.)

Second important thought: we know that we can make progress by
treating dictionary arguments as static and worth specialising on.  So
we can do without binding-time analysis, and instead specialise on
dictionary arguments and no others.

The basic idea
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have

        let f = <f_rhs>
        in <body>

and suppose f is overloaded.

STEP 1: CALL-INSTANCE COLLECTION

We traverse <body>, accumulating all applications of f to types and
dictionaries.

(Might there be partial applications, to just some of its types and
dictionaries?  In principle yes, but in practice the type checker only
builds applications of f to all its types and dictionaries, so partial
applications could only arise as a result of transformation, and even
then I think it's unlikely.  In any case, we simply don't accumulate such
partial applications.)


STEP 2: EQUIVALENCES

So now we have a collection of calls to f:
        f t1 t2 d1 d2
        f t3 t4 d3 d4
        ...
Notice that f may take several type arguments.  To avoid ambiguity, we
say that f is called at type t1/t2 and t3/t4.

We take equivalence classes using equality of the *types* (ignoring
the dictionary args, which as mentioned previously are redundant).

STEP 3: SPECIALISATION

For each equivalence class, choose a representative (f t1 t2 d1 d2),
and create a local instance of f, defined thus:

        f@t1/t2 = <f_rhs> t1 t2 d1 d2

f_rhs presumably has some big lambdas and dictionary lambdas, so lots
of simplification will now result.  However we don't actually *do* that
simplification.  Rather, we leave it for the simplifier to do.  If we
*did* do it, though, we'd get more call instances from the specialised
RHS.  We can work out what they are by instantiating the call-instance
set from f's RHS with the types t1, t2.

Add this new id to f's IdInfo, to record that f has a specialised version.

Before doing any of this, check that f's IdInfo doesn't already
tell us about an existing instance of f at the required type/s.
(This might happen if specialisation was applied more than once, or
it might arise from user SPECIALIZE pragmas.)

Recursion
~~~~~~~~~
Wait a minute!  What if f is recursive?  Then we can't just plug in
its right-hand side, can we?

But it's ok.  The type checker *always* creates non-recursive definitions
for overloaded recursive functions.  For example:

        f x = f (x+x)           -- Yes I know its silly

becomes

        f a (d::Num a) = let p = +.sel a d
                         in
                         letrec fl (y::a) = fl (p y y)
                         in
                         fl

We still have recursion for non-overloaded functions which we
specialise, but the recursive call should get specialised to the
same recursive version.


Polymorphism 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All this is crystal clear when the function is applied to *constant
types*; that is, types which have no type variables inside.  But what if
it is applied to non-constant types?  Suppose we find a call of f at type
t1/t2.  There are two possibilities:

(a) The free type variables of t1, t2 are in scope at the definition point
of f.  In this case there's no problem, we proceed just as before.  A common
example is as follows.  Here's the Haskell:

        g y = let f x = x+x
              in f y + f y

After typechecking we have

        g a (d::Num a) (y::a) = let f b (d'::Num b) (x::b) = +.sel b d' x x
                                in +.sel a d (f a d y) (f a d y)

Notice that the call to f is at type type "a"; a non-constant type.
Both calls to f are at the same type, so we can specialise to give:

        g a (d::Num a) (y::a) = let f@a (x::a) = +.sel a d x x
                                in +.sel a d (f@a y) (f@a y)


(b) The other case is when the type variables in the instance types
are *not* in scope at the definition point of f.  The example we are
working with above is a good case.  There are two instances of (+.sel a d),
but "a" is not in scope at the definition of +.sel.  Can we do anything?
Yes, we can "common them up", a sort of limited common sub-expression deal.
This would give:

        g a (d::Num a) (y::a) = let +.sel@a = +.sel a d
                                    f@a (x::a) = +.sel@a x x
                                in +.sel@a (f@a y) (f@a y)

This can save work, and can't be spotted by the type checker, because
the two instances of +.sel weren't originally at the same type.

Further notes on (b)

* There are quite a few variations here.  For example, the defn of
  +.sel could be floated outside the \y, to attempt to gain laziness.
  It certainly mustn't be floated outside the \d because the d has to
  be in scope too.

* We don't want to inline f_rhs in this case, because
that will duplicate code.  Just commoning up the call is the point.

* Nothing gets added to +.sel's IdInfo.

* Don't bother unless the equivalence class has more than one item!

Not clear whether this is all worth it.  It is of course OK to
simply discard call-instances when passing a big lambda.

Polymorphism 2 -- Overloading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider a function whose most general type is

        f :: forall a b. Ord a => [a] -> b -> b

There is really no point in making a version of g at Int/Int and another
at Int/Bool, because it's only instancing the type variable "a" which
buys us any efficiency. Since g is completely polymorphic in b there
ain't much point in making separate versions of g for the different
b types.

That suggests that we should identify which of g's type variables
are constrained (like "a") and which are unconstrained (like "b").
Then when taking equivalence classes in STEP 2, we ignore the type args
corresponding to unconstrained type variable.  In STEP 3 we make
polymorphic versions.  Thus:

        f@t1/ = /\b -> <f_rhs> t1 b d1 d2

We do this.


Dictionary floating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this

        f a (d::Num a) = let g = ...
                         in
                         ...(let d1::Ord a = Num.Ord.sel a d in g a d1)...

Here, g is only called at one type, but the dictionary isn't in scope at the
definition point for g.  Usually the type checker would build a
definition for d1 which enclosed g, but the transformation system
might have moved d1's defn inward.  Solution: float dictionary bindings
outwards along with call instances.

Consider

        f x = let g p q = p==q
                  h r s = (r+s, g r s)
              in
              h x x


Before specialisation, leaving out type abstractions we have

        f df x = let g :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
                     g dg p q = == dg p q
                     h :: Num a => a -> a -> (a, Bool)
                     h dh r s = let deq = eqFromNum dh
                                in (+ dh r s, g deq r s)
              in
              h df x x

After specialising h we get a specialised version of h, like this:

                    h' r s = let deq = eqFromNum df
                             in (+ df r s, g deq r s)

But we can't naively make an instance for g from this, because deq is not in scope
at the defn of g.  Instead, we have to float out the (new) defn of deq
to widen its scope.  Notice that this floating can't be done in advance -- it only
shows up when specialisation is done.

User SPECIALIZE pragmas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specialisation pragmas can be digested by the type checker, and implemented
by adding extra definitions along with that of f, in the same way as before

        f@t1/t2 = <f_rhs> t1 t2 d1 d2

Indeed the pragmas *have* to be dealt with by the type checker, because
only it knows how to build the dictionaries d1 and d2!  For example

        g :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
        {-# SPECIALIZE f :: [Tree Int] -> [Tree Int] #-}

Here, the specialised version of g is an application of g's rhs to the
Ord dictionary for (Tree Int), which only the type checker can conjure
up.  There might not even *be* one, if (Tree Int) is not an instance of
Ord!  (All the other specialisation has suitable dictionaries to hand
from actual calls.)

Problem.  The type checker doesn't have to hand a convenient <f_rhs>, because
it is buried in a complex (as-yet-un-desugared) binding group.
Maybe we should say

        f@t1/t2 = f* t1 t2 d1 d2

where f* is the Id f with an IdInfo which says "inline me regardless!".
Indeed all the specialisation could be done in this way.
That in turn means that the simplifier has to be prepared to inline absolutely
any in-scope let-bound thing.


Again, the pragma should permit polymorphism in unconstrained variables:

        h :: Ord a => [a] -> b -> b
        {-# SPECIALIZE h :: [Int] -> b -> b #-}

We *insist* that all overloaded type variables are specialised to ground types,
(and hence there can be no context inside a SPECIALIZE pragma).
We *permit* unconstrained type variables to be specialised to
        - a ground type
        - or left as a polymorphic type variable
but nothing in between.  So

        {-# SPECIALIZE h :: [Int] -> [c] -> [c] #-}

is *illegal*.  (It can be handled, but it adds complication, and gains the
programmer nothing.)


SPECIALISING INSTANCE DECLARATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider

        instance Foo a => Foo [a] where
                ...
        {-# SPECIALIZE instance Foo [Int] #-}

The original instance decl creates a dictionary-function
definition:

        dfun.Foo.List :: forall a. Foo a -> Foo [a]

The SPECIALIZE pragma just makes a specialised copy, just as for
ordinary function definitions:

        dfun.Foo.List@Int :: Foo [Int]
        dfun.Foo.List@Int = dfun.Foo.List Int dFooInt

The information about what instance of the dfun exist gets added to
the dfun's IdInfo in the same way as a user-defined function too.


Automatic instance decl specialisation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Can instance decls be specialised automatically?  It's tricky.
We could collect call-instance information for each dfun, but
then when we specialised their bodies we'd get new call-instances
for ordinary functions; and when we specialised their bodies, we might get
new call-instances of the dfuns, and so on.  This all arises because of
the unrestricted mutual recursion between instance decls and value decls.

Still, there's no actual problem; it just means that we may not do all
the specialisation we could theoretically do.

Furthermore, instance decls are usually exported and used non-locally,
so we'll want to compile enough to get those specialisations done.

Lastly, there's no such thing as a local instance decl, so we can
survive solely by spitting out *usage* information, and then reading that
back in as a pragma when next compiling the file.  So for now,
we only specialise instance decls in response to pragmas.


SPITTING OUT USAGE INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To spit out usage information we need to traverse the code collecting
call-instance information for all imported (non-prelude?) functions
and data types. Then we equivalence-class it and spit it out.

This is done at the top-level when all the call instances which escape
must be for imported functions and data types.

*** Not currently done ***


Partial specialisation by pragmas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What about partial specialisation:

        k :: (Ord a, Eq b) => [a] -> b -> b -> [a]
        {-# SPECIALIZE k :: Eq b => [Int] -> b -> b -> [a] #-}

or even

        {-# SPECIALIZE k :: Eq b => [Int] -> [b] -> [b] -> [a] #-}

Seems quite reasonable.  Similar things could be done with instance decls:

        instance (Foo a, Foo b) => Foo (a,b) where
                ...
        {-# SPECIALIZE instance Foo a => Foo (a,Int) #-}
        {-# SPECIALIZE instance Foo b => Foo (Int,b) #-}

Ho hum.  Things are complex enough without this.  I pass.


Requirements for the simplifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The simplifier has to be able to take advantage of the specialisation.

* When the simplifier finds an application of a polymorphic f, it looks in
f's IdInfo in case there is a suitable instance to call instead.  This converts

        f t1 t2 d1 d2   ===>   f_t1_t2

Note that the dictionaries get eaten up too!

* Dictionary selection operations on constant dictionaries must be
  short-circuited:

        +.sel Int d     ===>  +Int

The obvious way to do this is in the same way as other specialised
calls: +.sel has inside it some IdInfo which tells that if it's applied
to the type Int then it should eat a dictionary and transform to +Int.

In short, dictionary selectors need IdInfo inside them for constant
methods.

* Exactly the same applies if a superclass dictionary is being
  extracted:

        Eq.sel Int d   ===>   dEqInt

* Something similar applies to dictionary construction too.  Suppose
dfun.Eq.List is the function taking a dictionary for (Eq a) to
one for (Eq [a]).  Then we want

        dfun.Eq.List Int d      ===> dEq.List_Int

Where does the Eq [Int] dictionary come from?  It is built in
response to a SPECIALIZE pragma on the Eq [a] instance decl.

In short, dfun Ids need IdInfo with a specialisation for each
constant instance of their instance declaration.

All this uses a single mechanism: the SpecEnv inside an Id


What does the specialisation IdInfo look like?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SpecEnv of an Id maps a list of types (the template) to an expression

        [Type]  |->  Expr

For example, if f has this RuleInfo:

        [Int, a]  ->  \d:Ord Int. f' a

it means that we can replace the call

        f Int t  ===>  (\d. f' t)

This chucks one dictionary away and proceeds with the
specialised version of f, namely f'.


What can't be done this way?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no way, post-typechecker, to get a dictionary for (say)
Eq a from a dictionary for Eq [a].  So if we find

        ==.sel [t] d

we can't transform to

        eqList (==.sel t d')

where
        eqList :: (a->a->Bool) -> [a] -> [a] -> Bool

Of course, we currently have no way to automatically derive
eqList, nor to connect it to the Eq [a] instance decl, but you
can imagine that it might somehow be possible.  Taking advantage
of this is permanently ruled out.

Still, this is no great hardship, because we intend to eliminate
overloading altogether anyway!

A note about non-tyvar dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some Ids have types like

        forall a,b,c. Eq a -> Ord [a] -> tau

This seems curious at first, because we usually only have dictionary
args whose types are of the form (C a) where a is a type variable.
But this doesn't hold for the functions arising from instance decls,
which sometimes get arguments with types of form (C (T a)) for some
type constructor T.

Should we specialise wrt this compound-type dictionary?  We used to say
"no", saying:
        "This is a heuristic judgement, as indeed is the fact that we
        specialise wrt only dictionaries.  We choose *not* to specialise
        wrt compound dictionaries because at the moment the only place
        they show up is in instance decls, where they are simply plugged
        into a returned dictionary.  So nothing is gained by specialising
        wrt them."

But it is simpler and more uniform to specialise wrt these dicts too;
and in future GHC is likely to support full fledged type signatures
like
        f :: Eq [(a,b)] => ...


************************************************************************
*                                                                      *
\subsubsection{The new specialiser}
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

Our basic game plan is this.  For let(rec) bound function
        f :: (C a, D c) => (a,b,c,d) -> Bool

* Find any specialised calls of f, (f ts ds), where
  ts are the type arguments t1 .. t4, and
  ds are the dictionary arguments d1 .. d2.

* Add a new definition for f1 (say):

        f1 = /\ b d -> (..body of f..) t1 b t3 d d1 d2

  Note that we abstract over the unconstrained type arguments.

* Add the mapping

        [t1,b,t3,d]  |->  \d1 d2 -> f1 b d

  to the specialisations of f.  This will be used by the
  simplifier to replace calls
                (f t1 t2 t3 t4) da db
  by
                (\d1 d1 -> f1 t2 t4) da db

  All the stuff about how many dictionaries to discard, and what types
  to apply the specialised function to, are handled by the fact that the
  SpecEnv contains a template for the result of the specialisation.

We don't build *partial* specialisations for f.  For example:

  f :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
  {-# SPECIALISE f :: (Eq b, Eq c) => (b,c) -> (b,c) -> Bool #-}

Here, little is gained by making a specialised copy of f.
There's a distinct danger that the specialised version would
first build a dictionary for (Eq b, Eq c), and then select the (==)
method from it!  Even if it didn't, not a great deal is saved.

We do, however, generate polymorphic, but not overloaded, specialisations:

  f :: Eq a => [a] -> b -> b -> b
  ... SPECIALISE f :: [Int] -> b -> b -> b ...

Hence, the invariant is this:

        *** no specialised version is overloaded ***

Note [Specialise imported INLINABLE things]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What imported functions do we specialise?  The basic set is
 * DFuns and things with INLINABLE pragmas.
but with -fspecialise-aggressively we add
 * Anything with an unfolding template

Trac #8874 has a good example of why we want to auto-specialise DFuns.

We have the -fspecialise-aggressively flag (usually off), because we
risk lots of orphan modules from over-vigorous specialisation.
However it's not a big deal: anything non-recursive with an
unfolding-template will probably have been inlined already.

Note [Glom the bindings if imported functions are specialised]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have an imported, *recursive*, INLINABLE function
   f :: Eq a => a -> a
   f = /\a \d x. ...(f a d)...
In the module being compiled we have
   g x = f (x::Int)
Now we'll make a specialised function
   f_spec :: Int -> Int
   f_spec = \x -> ...(f Int dInt)...
   {-# RULE  f Int _ = f_spec #-}
   g = \x. f Int dInt x
Note that f_spec doesn't look recursive
After rewriting with the RULE, we get
   f_spec = \x -> ...(f_spec)...
BUT since f_spec was non-recursive before it'll *stay* non-recursive.
The occurrence analyser never turns a NonRec into a Rec.  So we must
make sure that f_spec is recursive.  Easiest thing is to make all
the specialisations for imported bindings recursive.


Note [Avoiding recursive specialisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we specialise 'f' we may find new overloaded calls to 'g', 'h' in
'f's RHS.  So we want to specialise g,h.  But we don't want to
specialise f any more!  It's possible that f's RHS might have a
recursive yet-more-specialised call, so we'd diverge in that case.
And if the call is to the same type, one specialisation is enough.
Avoiding this recursive specialisation loop is the reason for the
'done' VarSet passed to specImports and specImport.

{-
Note [Floating dictionaries out of cases]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   g = \d. case d of { MkD sc ... -> ...(f sc)... }
Naively we can't float d2's binding out of the case expression,
because 'sc' is bound by the case, and that in turn means we can't
specialise f, which seems a pity.

So we invert the case, by floating out a binding
for 'sc_flt' thus:
    sc_flt = case d of { MkD sc ... -> sc }
Now we can float the call instance for 'f'.  Indeed this is just
what'll happen if 'sc' was originally bound with a let binding,
but case is more efficient, and necessary with equalities. So it's
good to work with both.

You might think that this won't make any difference, because the
call instance will only get nuked by the \d.  BUT if 'g' itself is
specialised, then transitively we should be able to specialise f.

In general, given
   case e of cb { MkD sc ... -> ...(f sc)... }
we transform to
   let cb_flt = e
       sc_flt = case cb_flt of { MkD sc ... -> sc }
   in
   case cb_flt of bg { MkD sc ... -> ....(f sc_flt)... }

The "_flt" things are the floated binds; we use the current substitution
to substitute sc -> sc_flt in the RHS

Note [Make the new dictionaries interesting]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Important!  We're going to substitute dx_id1 for d
and we want it to look "interesting", else we won't gather *any*
consequential calls. E.g.
    f d = ...g d....
If we specialise f for a call (f (dfun dNumInt)), we'll get
a consequent call (g d') with an auxiliary definition
    d' = df dNumInt
We want that consequent call to look interesting


Note [From non-recursive to recursive]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Even in the non-recursive case, if any dict-binds depend on 'fn' we might
have built a recursive knot

      f a d x = <blah>
      MkUD { ud_binds = d7 = MkD ..f..
           , ud_calls = ...(f T d7)... }

The we generate

      Rec { fs x = <blah>[T/a, d7/d]
            f a d x = <blah>
               RULE f T _ = fs
            d7 = ...f... }

Here the recursion is only through the RULE.


Note [Specialisation of dictionary functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is a nasty example that bit us badly: see Trac #3591

     class Eq a => C a
     instance Eq [a] => C [a]

---------------
     dfun :: Eq [a] -> C [a]
     dfun a d = MkD a d (meth d)

     d4 :: Eq [T] = <blah>
     d2 ::  C [T] = dfun T d4
     d1 :: Eq [T] = $p1 d2
     d3 ::  C [T] = dfun T d1

None of these definitions is recursive. What happened was that we
generated a specialisation:

     RULE forall d. dfun T d = dT  :: C [T]
     dT = (MkD a d (meth d)) [T/a, d1/d]
        = MkD T d1 (meth d1)

But now we use the RULE on the RHS of d2, to get

    d2 = dT = MkD d1 (meth d1)
    d1 = $p1 d2

and now d1 is bottom!  The problem is that when specialising 'dfun' we
should first dump "below" the binding all floated dictionary bindings
that mention 'dfun' itself.  So d2 and d3 (and hence d1) must be
placed below 'dfun', and thus unavailable to it when specialising
'dfun'.  That in turn means that the call (dfun T d1) must be
discarded.  On the other hand, the call (dfun T d4) is fine, assuming
d4 doesn't mention dfun.

But look at this:

  class C a where { foo,bar :: [a] -> [a] }

  instance C Int where
     foo x = r_bar x
     bar xs = reverse xs

  r_bar :: C a => [a] -> [a]
  r_bar xs = bar (xs ++ xs)

That translates to:

    r_bar a (c::C a) (xs::[a]) = bar a d (xs ++ xs)

    Rec { $fCInt :: C Int = MkC foo_help reverse
          foo_help (xs::[Int]) = r_bar Int $fCInt xs }

The call (r_bar $fCInt) mentions $fCInt,
                        which mentions foo_help,
                        which mentions r_bar
But we DO want to specialise r_bar at Int:

    Rec { $fCInt :: C Int = MkC foo_help reverse
          foo_help (xs::[Int]) = r_bar Int $fCInt xs

          r_bar a (c::C a) (xs::[a]) = bar a d (xs ++ xs)
            RULE r_bar Int _ = r_bar_Int

          r_bar_Int xs = bar Int $fCInt (xs ++ xs)
           }

Note that, because of its RULE, r_bar joins the recursive
group.  (In this case it'll unravel a short moment later.)


Conclusion: we catch the nasty case using filter_dfuns in
callsForMe. To be honest I'm not 100% certain that this is 100%
right, but it works.  Sigh.


Note [Specialising a recursive group]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
    let rec { f x = ...g x'...
            ; g y = ...f y'.... }
    in f 'a'
Here we specialise 'f' at Char; but that is very likely to lead to
a specialisation of 'g' at Char.  We must do the latter, else the
whole point of specialisation is lost.

But we do not want to keep iterating to a fixpoint, because in the
presence of polymorphic recursion we might generate an infinite number
of specialisations.

So we use the following heuristic:
  * Arrange the rec block in dependency order, so far as possible
    (the occurrence analyser already does this)

  * Specialise it much like a sequence of lets

  * Then go through the block a second time, feeding call-info from
    the RHSs back in the bottom, as it were

In effect, the ordering maximises the effectiveness of each sweep,
and we do just two sweeps.   This should catch almost every case of
monomorphic recursion -- the exception could be a very knotted-up
recursion with multiple cycles tied up together.

This plan is implemented in the Rec case of specBindItself.

Note [Specialisations already covered]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We obviously don't want to generate two specialisations for the same
argument pattern.  There are two wrinkles

1. We do the already-covered test in specDefn, not when we generate
the CallInfo in mkCallUDs.  We used to test in the latter place, but
we now iterate the specialiser somewhat, and the Id at the call site
might therefore not have all the RULES that we can see in specDefn

2. What about two specialisations where the second is an *instance*
of the first?  If the more specific one shows up first, we'll generate
specialisations for both.  If the *less* specific one shows up first,
we *don't* currently generate a specialisation for the more specific
one.  (See the call to lookupRule in already_covered.)  Reasons:
  (a) lookupRule doesn't say which matches are exact (bad reason)
  (b) if the earlier specialisation is user-provided, it's
      far from clear that we should auto-specialise further

Note [Auto-specialisation and RULES]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider:
   g :: Num a => a -> a
   g = ...

   f :: (Int -> Int) -> Int
   f w = ...
   {-# RULE f g = 0 #-}

Suppose that auto-specialisation makes a specialised version of
g::Int->Int That version won't appear in the LHS of the RULE for f.
So if the specialisation rule fires too early, the rule for f may
never fire.

It might be possible to add new rules, to "complete" the rewrite system.
Thus when adding
        RULE forall d. g Int d = g_spec
also add
        RULE f g_spec = 0

But that's a bit complicated.  For now we ask the programmer's help,
by *copying the INLINE activation pragma* to the auto-specialised
rule.  So if g says {-# NOINLINE[2] g #-}, then the auto-spec rule
will also not be active until phase 2.  And that's what programmers
should jolly well do anyway, even aside from specialisation, to ensure
that g doesn't inline too early.

This in turn means that the RULE would never fire for a NOINLINE
thing so not much point in generating a specialisation at all.

Note [Specialisation shape]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We only specialise a function if it has visible top-level lambdas
corresponding to its overloading.  E.g. if
        f :: forall a. Eq a => ....
then its body must look like
        f = /\a. \d. ...

Reason: when specialising the body for a call (f ty dexp), we want to
substitute dexp for d, and pick up specialised calls in the body of f.

This doesn't always work.  One example I came across was this:
        newtype Gen a = MkGen{ unGen :: Int -> a }

        choose :: Eq a => a -> Gen a
        choose n = MkGen (\r -> n)

        oneof = choose (1::Int)

It's a silly example, but we get
        choose = /\a. g `cast` co
where choose doesn't have any dict arguments.  Thus far I have not
tried to fix this (wait till there's a real example).

Mind you, then 'choose' will be inlined (since RHS is trivial) so
it doesn't matter.  This comes up with single-method classes

   class C a where { op :: a -> a }
   instance C a => C [a] where ....
==>
   $fCList :: C a => C [a]
   $fCList = $copList |> (...coercion>...)
   ....(uses of $fCList at particular types)...

So we suppress the WARN if the rhs is trivial.

Note [Inline specialisations]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here is what we do with the InlinePragma of the original function
  * Activation/RuleMatchInfo: both transferred to the
                              specialised function
  * InlineSpec:
       (a) An INLINE pragma is transferred
       (b) An INLINABLE pragma is *not* transferred

Why (a): transfer INLINE pragmas? The point of INLINE was precisely to
specialise the function at its call site, and arguably that's not so
important for the specialised copies.  BUT *pragma-directed*
specialisation now takes place in the typechecker/desugarer, with
manually specified INLINEs.  The specialisation here is automatic.
It'd be very odd if a function marked INLINE was specialised (because
of some local use), and then forever after (including importing
modules) the specialised version wasn't INLINEd.  After all, the
programmer said INLINE!

You might wonder why we specialise INLINE functions at all.  After
all they should be inlined, right?  Two reasons:

 * Even INLINE functions are sometimes not inlined, when they aren't
   applied to interesting arguments.  But perhaps the type arguments
   alone are enough to specialise (even though the args are too boring
   to trigger inlining), and it's certainly better to call the
   specialised version.

 * The RHS of an INLINE function might call another overloaded function,
   and we'd like to generate a specialised version of that function too.
   This actually happens a lot. Consider
      replicateM_ :: (Monad m) => Int -> m a -> m ()
      {-# INLINABLE replicateM_ #-}
      replicateM_ d x ma = ...
   The strictness analyser may transform to
      replicateM_ :: (Monad m) => Int -> m a -> m ()
      {-# INLINE replicateM_ #-}
      replicateM_ d x ma = case x of I# x' -> $wreplicateM_ d x' ma

      $wreplicateM_ :: (Monad m) => Int# -> m a -> m ()
      {-# INLINABLE $wreplicateM_ #-}
      $wreplicateM_ = ...
   Now an importing module has a specialised call to replicateM_, say
   (replicateM_ dMonadIO).  We certainly want to specialise $wreplicateM_!
   This particular example had a huge effect on the call to replicateM_
   in nofib/shootout/n-body.

Why (b): discard INLINEABLE pragmas? See Trac #4874 for persuasive examples.
Suppose we have
    {-# INLINABLE f #-}
    f :: Ord a => [a] -> Int
    f xs = letrec f' = ...f'... in f'
Then, when f is specialised and optimised we might get
    wgo :: [Int] -> Int#
    wgo = ...wgo...
    f_spec :: [Int] -> Int
    f_spec xs = case wgo xs of { r -> I# r }
and we clearly want to inline f_spec at call sites.  But if we still
have the big, un-optimised of f (albeit specialised) captured in an
INLINABLE pragma for f_spec, we won't get that optimisation.

So we simply drop INLINABLE pragmas when specialising. It's not really
a complete solution; ignoring specialisation for now, INLINABLE functions
don't get properly strictness analysed, for example. But it works well
for examples involving specialisation, which is the dominant use of
INLINABLE.  See Trac #4874.

{-
Note [Type determines value]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only specialise if all overloading is on non-IP *class* params,
because these are the ones whose *type* determines their *value*.  In
particular, with implicit params, the type args *don't* say what the
value of the implicit param is!  See Trac #7101

However, consider
         type family D (v::*->*) :: Constraint
         type instance D [] = ()
         f :: D v => v Char -> Int
If we see a call (f "foo"), we'll pass a "dictionary"
  () |> (g :: () ~ D [])
and it's good to specialise f at this dictionary.

So the question is: can an implicit parameter "hide inside" a
type-family constraint like (D a).  Well, no.  We don't allow
        type instance D Maybe = ?x:Int
Hence the IrredPred case in type_determines_value.
See Trac #7785.

Note [Interesting dictionary arguments]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this
         \a.\d:Eq a.  let f = ... in ...(f d)...
There really is not much point in specialising f wrt the dictionary d,
because the code for the specialised f is not improved at all, because
d is lambda-bound.  We simply get junk specialisations.

What is "interesting"?  Just that it has *some* structure.  But what about
variables?

 * A variable might be imported, in which case its unfolding
   will tell us whether it has useful structure

 * Local variables are cloned on the way down (to avoid clashes when
   we float dictionaries), and cloning drops the unfolding
   (cloneIdBndr).  Moreover, we make up some new bindings, and it's a
   nuisance to give them unfoldings.  So we keep track of the
   "interesting" dictionaries as a VarSet in SpecEnv.
   We have to take care to put any new interesting dictionary
   bindings in the set.

We accidentally lost accurate tracking of local variables for a long
time, because cloned variables don't have unfoldings. But makes a
massive difference in a few cases, eg Trac #5113. For nofib as a
whole it's only a small win: 2.2% improvement in allocation for ansi,
1.2% for bspt, but mostly 0.0!  Average 0.1% increase in binary size.

                Old (but interesting) stuff about unboxed bindings
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What should we do when a value is specialised to a *strict* unboxed value?

        map_*_* f (x:xs) = let h = f x
                               t = map f xs
                           in h:t

Could convert let to case:

        map_*_Int# f (x:xs) = case f x of h# ->
                              let t = map f xs
                              in h#:t

This may be undesirable since it forces evaluation here, but the value
may not be used in all branches of the body. In the general case this
transformation is impossible since the mutual recursion in a letrec
cannot be expressed as a case.

There is also a problem with top-level unboxed values, since our
implementation cannot handle unboxed values at the top level.

Solution: Lift the binding of the unboxed value and extract it when it
is used:

        map_*_Int# f (x:xs) = let h = case (f x) of h# -> _Lift h#
                                  t = map f xs
                              in case h of
                                 _Lift h# -> h#:t

Now give it to the simplifier and the _Lifting will be optimised away.

The benefit is that we have given the specialised "unboxed" values a
very simplep lifted semantics and then leave it up to the simplifier to
optimise it --- knowing that the overheads will be removed in nearly
all cases.

In particular, the value will only be evaluated in the branches of the
program which use it, rather than being forced at the point where the
value is bound. For example:

        filtermap_*_* p f (x:xs)
          = let h = f x
                t = ...
            in case p x of
                True  -> h:t
                False -> t
   ==>
        filtermap_*_Int# p f (x:xs)
          = let h = case (f x) of h# -> _Lift h#
                t = ...
            in case p x of
                True  -> case h of _Lift h#
                           -> h#:t
                False -> t

The binding for h can still be inlined in the one branch and the
_Lifting eliminated.


Question: When won't the _Lifting be eliminated?

Answer: When they at the top-level (where it is necessary) or when
inlining would duplicate work (or possibly code depending on
options). However, the _Lifting will still be eliminated if the
strictness analyser deems the lifted binding strict.
