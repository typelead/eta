The liberate-case transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module walks over @Core@, and looks for @case@ on free variables.
The criterion is:
        if there is case on a free on the route to the recursive call,
        then the recursive call is replaced with an unfolding.

Example

   f = \ t -> case v of
                 V a b -> a : f t

=> the inner f is replaced.

   f = \ t -> case v of
                 V a b -> a : (letrec
                                f =  \ t -> case v of
                                               V a b -> a : f t
                               in f) t
(note the NEED for shadowing)

=> Simplify

  f = \ t -> case v of
                 V a b -> a : (letrec
                                f = \ t -> a : f t
                               in f t)

Better code, because 'a' is  free inside the inner letrec, rather
than needing projection from v.

Note that this deals with *free variables*.  SpecConstr deals with
*arguments* that are of known form.  E.g.

        last []     = error
        last (x:[]) = x
        last (x:xs) = last xs


Note [Scrutinee with cast]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this:
    f = \ t -> case (v `cast` co) of
                 V a b -> a : f t

Exactly the same optimisation (unrolling one call to f) will work here,
despite the cast.  See mk_alt_env in the Case branch of libCase.


Note [Only functions!]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the following code

       f = g (case v of V a b -> a : t f)

where g is expensive. If we aren't careful, liberate case will turn this into

       f = g (case v of
               V a b -> a : t (letrec f = g (case v of V a b -> a : f t)
                                in f)
             )

Yikes! We evaluate g twice. This leads to a O(2^n) explosion
if g calls back to the same code recursively.

Solution: make sure that we only do the liberate-case thing on *functions*

To think about (Apr 94)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Main worry: duplicating code excessively.  At the moment we duplicate
the entire binding group once at each recursive call.  But there may
be a group of recursive calls which share a common set of evaluated
free variables, in which case the duplication is a plain waste.

Another thing we could consider adding is some unfold-threshold thing,
so that we'll only duplicate if the size of the group rhss isn't too
big.

Data types
~~~~~~~~~~
The ``level'' of a binder tells how many
recursive defns lexically enclose the binding
A recursive defn "encloses" its RHS, not its
scope.  For example:
\begin{verbatim}
        letrec f = let g = ... in ...
        in
        let h = ...
        in ...
\end{verbatim}
Here, the level of @f@ is zero, the level of @g@ is one,
and the level of @h@ is zero (NB not one).

{-
Note [Need to localiseId in libCaseBind]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The call to localiseId is needed for two subtle reasons
(a)  Reset the export flags on the binders so
        that we don't get name clashes on exported things if the
        local binding floats out to top level.  This is most unlikely
        to happen, since the whole point concerns free variables.
        But resetting the export flag is right regardless.

(b)  Make the name an Internal one.  External Names should never be
        nested; if it were floated to the top level, we'd get a name
        clash at code generation time.

Note [Small enough]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
  \fv. letrec
         f = \x. BIG...(case fv of { (a,b) -> ...g.. })...
         g = \y. SMALL...f...
Then we *can* do liberate-case on g (small RHS) but not for f (too big).
But we can choose on a item-by-item basis, and that's what the
rhs_small_enough call in the comprehension for env_rhs does.

Note [When to specialise]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
  f = \x. letrec g = \y. case x of
                           True  -> ... (f a) ...
                           False -> ... (g b) ...

We get the following levels
          f  0
          x  1
          g  1
          y  2

Then 'x' is being scrutinised at a deeper level than its binding, so
it's added to lc_scruts:  [(x,1)]

We do *not* want to specialise the call to 'f', because 'x' is not free
in 'f'.  So here the bind-level of 'x' (=1) is not <= the bind-level of 'f' (=0).

We *do* want to specialise the call to 'g', because 'x' is free in g.
Here the bind-level of 'x' (=1) is <= the bind-level of 'g' (=1).

Note [Avoiding fruitless liberate-case]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider also:
  f = \x. case top_lvl_thing of
                I# _ -> let g = \y. ... g ...
                        in ...

Here, top_lvl_thing is scrutinised at a level (1) deeper than its
binding site (0).  Nevertheless, we do NOT want to specialise the call
to 'g' because all the structure in its free variables is already
visible at the definition site for g.  Hence, when considering specialising
an occurrence of 'g', we want to check that there's a scruted-var v st

   a) v's binding site is *outside* g
   b) v's scrutinisation site is *inside* g
