        -----------------
        Overall game plan
        -----------------

The Big Main Idea is:

        To float out sub-expressions that can thereby get outside
        a non-one-shot value lambda, and hence may be shared.


To achieve this we may need to do two thing:

   a) Let-bind the sub-expression:

        f (g x)  ==>  let lvl = f (g x) in lvl

      Now we can float the binding for 'lvl'.

   b) More than that, we may need to abstract wrt a type variable

        \x -> ... /\a -> let v = ...a... in ....

      Here the binding for v mentions 'a' but not 'x'.  So we
      abstract wrt 'a', to give this binding for 'v':

            vp = /\a -> ...a...
            v  = vp a

      Now the binding for vp can float out unimpeded.
      I can't remember why this case seemed important enough to
      deal with, but I certainly found cases where important floats
      didn't happen if we did not abstract wrt tyvars.

With this in mind we can also achieve another goal: lambda lifting.
We can make an arbitrary (function) binding float to top level by
abstracting wrt *all* local variables, not just type variables, leaving
a binding that can be floated right to top level.  Whether or not this
happens is controlled by a flag.


Random comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the moment we never float a binding out to between two adjacent
lambdas.  For example:

@
        \x y -> let t = x+x in ...
===>
        \x -> let t = x+x in \y -> ...
@
Reason: this is less efficient in the case where the original lambda
is never partially applied.

But there's a case I've seen where this might not be true.  Consider:
@
elEm2 x ys
  = elem' x ys
  where
    elem' _ []  = False
    elem' x (y:ys)      = x==y || elem' x ys
@
It turns out that this generates a subexpression of the form
@
        \deq x ys -> let eq = eqFromEqDict deq in ...
@
which might usefully be separated to
@
        \deq -> let eq = eqFromEqDict deq in \xy -> ...
@
Well, maybe.  We don't do this at the moment.

Note [Floating out of Rec rhss]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider   Rec { f<1,0> = \xy. body }
From the body we may get some floats. The ones with level <1,0> must
stay here, since they may mention f.  Ideally we'd like to make them
part of the Rec block pairs -- but we can't if there are any
FloatCases involved.

Nor is it a good idea to dump them in the rhs, but outside the lambda
    f = case x of I# y -> \xy. body
because now f's arity might get worse, which is Not Good. (And if
there's an SCC around the RHS it might not get better again.
See Trac #5342.)

So, gruesomely, we split the floats into
 * the outer FloatLets, which can join the Rec, and
 * an inner batch starting in a FloatCase, which are then
   pushed *inside* the lambdas.
This loses full-laziness the rare situation where there is a
FloatCase and a Rec interacting.

Note [floatBind for top level]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We may have a *nested* binding whose destination level is (FloatMe tOP_LEVEL), thus
         letrec { foo <0,0> = .... (let bar<0,0> = .. in ..) .... }
The binding for bar will be in the "tops" part of the floating binds,
and thus not partitioned by floatBody.

We could perhaps get rid of the 'tops' component of the floating binds,
but this case works just as well.

{- Note [Floating past breakpoints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notes from Peter Wortmann (re: #10052)

"This case clearly means we're trying to float past a breakpoint..."

Further:

"Breakpoints as they currently exist are the only Tikish that is not
scoped, counting, and not splittable.

This means that we can't:
  - Simply float code out of it, because the payload must still be covered (scoped)
  - Copy the tick, because it would change entry counts (here: duplicate breakpoints)"

While this seems like an odd case, it can apparently occur in real
life: through the combination of optimizations + GHCi usage. For an
example, see #10052 as mentioned above. So not only does the
interpreter not like some compiler-generated things (like unboxed
tuples), the compiler doesn't like interpreter-introduced things!

Also see Note [GHCi and -O] in GHC.hs.

Note [Avoiding unnecessary floating]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general we want to avoid floating a let unnecessarily, because
it might worsen strictness:
    let
       x = ...(let y = e in y+y)....
Here y is demanded.  If we float it outside the lazy 'x=..' then
we'd have to zap its demand info, and it may never be restored.

So at a 'let' we leave the binding right where the are unless
the binding will escape a value lambda, e.g.

(\x -> let y = fac 100 in y)

That's what the partitionByMajorLevel does in the floatExpr (Let ...)
case.

Notice, though, that we must take care to drop any bindings
from the body of the let that depend on the staying-put bindings.

We used instead to do the partitionByMajorLevel on the RHS of an '=',
in floatRhs.  But that was quite tiresome.  We needed to test for
values or trival rhss, because (in particular) we don't want to insert
new bindings between the "=" and the "\".  E.g.
        f = \x -> let <bind> in <body>
We do not want
        f = let <bind> in \x -> <body>
(a) The simplifier will immediately float it further out, so we may
        as well do so right now; in general, keeping rhss as manifest
        values is good
(b) If a float-in pass follows immediately, it might add yet more
        bindings just after the '='.  And some of them might (correctly)
        be strict even though the 'let f' is lazy, because f, being a value,
        gets its demand-info zapped by the simplifier.
And even all that turned out to be very fragile, and broke
altogether when profiling got in the way.

So now we do the partition right at the (Let..) itself.

Note [Representation of FloatBinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The FloatBinds types is somewhat important.  We can get very large numbers
of floating bindings, often all destined for the top level.  A typical example
is     x = [4,2,5,2,5, .... ]
Then we get lots of small expressions like (fromInteger 4), which all get
lifted to top level.

The trouble is that
  (a) we partition these floating bindings *at every binding site*
  (b) SetLevels introduces a new bindings site for every float
So we had better not look at each binding at each binding site!

That is why MajorEnv is represented as a finite map.

We keep the bindings destined for the *top* level separate, because
we float them out even if they don't escape a *value* lambda; see
partitionByMajorLevel.
