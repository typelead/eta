Note [Dead code]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dropping dead code for a cyclic Strongly Connected Component is done
in a very simple way:

        the entire SCC is dropped if none of its binders are mentioned
        in the body; otherwise the whole thing is kept.

The key observation is that dead code elimination happens after
dependency analysis: so 'occAnalBind' processes SCCs instead of the
original term's binding groups.

Thus 'occAnalBind' does indeed drop 'f' in an example like

        letrec f = ...g...
               g = ...(...g...)...
        in
           ...g...

when 'g' no longer uses 'f' at all (eg 'f' does not occur in a RULE in
'g'). 'occAnalBind' first consumes 'CyclicSCC g' and then it consumes
'AcyclicSCC f', where 'body_usage' won't contain 'f'.

------------------------------------------------------------
Note [Forming Rec groups]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We put bindings {f = ef; g = eg } in a Rec group if "f uses g"
and "g uses f", no matter how indirectly.  We do a SCC analysis
with an edge f -> g if "f uses g".

More precisely, "f uses g" iff g should be in scope wherever f is.
That is, g is free in:
  a) the rhs 'ef'
  b) or the RHS of a rule for f (Note [Rules are extra RHSs])
  c) or the LHS or a rule for f (Note [Rule dependency info])

These conditions apply regardless of the activation of the RULE (eg it might be
inactive in this phase but become active later).  Once a Rec is broken up
it can never be put back together, so we must be conservative.

The principle is that, regardless of rule firings, every variable is
always in scope.

  * Note [Rules are extra RHSs]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    A RULE for 'f' is like an extra RHS for 'f'. That way the "parent"
    keeps the specialised "children" alive.  If the parent dies
    (because it isn't referenced any more), then the children will die
    too (unless they are already referenced directly).

    To that end, we build a Rec group for each cyclic strongly
    connected component,
        *treating f's rules as extra RHSs for 'f'*.
    More concretely, the SCC analysis runs on a graph with an edge
    from f -> g iff g is mentioned in
        (a) f's rhs
        (b) f's RULES
    These are rec_edges.

    Under (b) we include variables free in *either* LHS *or* RHS of
    the rule.  The former might seems silly, but see Note [Rule
    dependency info].  So in Example [eftInt], eftInt and eftIntFB
    will be put in the same Rec, even though their 'main' RHSs are
    both non-recursive.

  * Note [Rule dependency info]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The VarSet in a RuleInfo is used for dependency analysis in the
    occurrence analyser.  We must track free vars in *both* lhs and rhs.
    Hence use of idRuleVars, rather than idRuleRhsVars in occAnalBind.
    Why both? Consider
        x = y
        RULE f x = v+4
    Then if we substitute y for x, we'd better do so in the
    rule's LHS too, so we'd better ensure the RULE appears to mention 'x'
    as well as 'v'

  * Note [Rules are visible in their own rec group]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    We want the rules for 'f' to be visible in f's right-hand side.
    And we'd like them to be visible in other functions in f's Rec
    group.  E.g. in Note [Specialisation rules] we want f' rule
    to be visible in both f's RHS, and fs's RHS.

    This means that we must simplify the RULEs first, before looking
    at any of the definitions.  This is done by Simplify.simplRecBind,
    when it calls addLetIdInfo.

------------------------------------------------------------
Note [Choosing loop breakers]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Loop breaking is surprisingly subtle.  First read the section 4 of
"Secrets of the GHC inliner".  This describes our basic plan.
We avoid infinite inlinings by choosing loop breakers, and
ensuring that a loop breaker cuts each loop.

Fundamentally, we do SCC analysis on a graph.  For each recursive
group we choose a loop breaker, delete all edges to that node,
re-analyse the SCC, and iterate.

But what is the graph?  NOT the same graph as was used for Note
[Forming Rec groups]!  In particular, a RULE is like an equation for
'f' that is *always* inlined if it is applicable.  We do *not* disable
rules for loop-breakers.  It's up to whoever makes the rules to make
sure that the rules themselves always terminate.  See Note [Rules for
recursive functions] in Simplify.lhs

Hence, if
    f's RHS (or its INLINE template if it has one) mentions g, and
    g has a RULE that mentions h, and
    h has a RULE that mentions f

then we *must* choose f to be a loop breaker.  Example: see Note
[Specialisation rules].

In general, take the free variables of f's RHS, and augment it with
all the variables reachable by RULES from those starting points.  That
is the whole reason for computing rule_fv_env in occAnalBind.  (Of
course we only consider free vars that are also binders in this Rec
group.)  See also Note [Finding rule RHS free vars]

Note that when we compute this rule_fv_env, we only consider variables
free in the *RHS* of the rule, in contrast to the way we build the
Rec group in the first place (Note [Rule dependency info])

Note that if 'g' has RHS that mentions 'w', we should add w to
g's loop-breaker edges.  More concretely there is an edge from f -> g
iff
        (a) g is mentioned in f's RHS `xor` f's INLINE rhs
            (see Note [Inline rules])
        (b) or h is mentioned in f's RHS, and
            g appears in the RHS of an active RULE of h
            or a transitive sequence of active rules starting with h

Why "active rules"?  See Note [Finding rule RHS free vars]

Note that in Example [eftInt], *neither* eftInt *nor* eftIntFB is
chosen as a loop breaker, because their RHSs don't mention each other.
And indeed both can be inlined safely.

Note again that the edges of the graph we use for computing loop breakers
are not the same as the edges we use for computing the Rec blocks.
That's why we compute

- rec_edges          for the Rec block analysis
- loop_breaker_edges for the loop breaker analysis

  * Note [Finding rule RHS free vars]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Consider this real example from Data Parallel Haskell
         tagZero :: Array Int -> Array Tag
         {-# INLINE [1] tagZeroes #-}
         tagZero xs = pmap (\x -> fromBool (x==0)) xs

         {-# RULES "tagZero" [~1] forall xs n.
             pmap fromBool <blah blah> = tagZero xs #-}
    So tagZero's RHS mentions pmap, and pmap's RULE mentions tagZero.
    However, tagZero can only be inlined in phase 1 and later, while
    the RULE is only active *before* phase 1.  So there's no problem.

    To make this work, we look for the RHS free vars only for
    *active* rules. That's the reason for the occ_rule_act field
    of the OccEnv.

  * Note [Weak loop breakers]
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    There is a last nasty wrinkle.  Suppose we have

        Rec { f = f_rhs
              RULE f [] = g

              h = h_rhs
              g = h
              ...more...
        }

    Remember that we simplify the RULES before any RHS (see Note
    [Rules are visible in their own rec group] above).

    So we must *not* postInlineUnconditionally 'g', even though
    its RHS turns out to be trivial.  (I'm assuming that 'g' is
    not chosen as a loop breaker.)  Why not?  Because then we
    drop the binding for 'g', which leaves it out of scope in the
    RULE!

    Here's a somewhat different example of the same thing
        Rec { g = h
            ; h = ...f...
            ; f = f_rhs
              RULE f [] = g }
    Here the RULE is "below" g, but we *still* can't postInlineUnconditionally
    g, because the RULE for f is active throughout.  So the RHS of h
    might rewrite to     h = ...g...
    So g must remain in scope in the output program!

    We "solve" this by:

        Make g a "weak" loop breaker (OccInfo = IAmLoopBreaker True)
        iff g is a "missing free variable" of the Rec group

    A "missing free variable" x is one that is mentioned in an RHS or
    INLINE or RULE of a binding in the Rec group, but where the
    dependency on x may not show up in the loop_breaker_edges (see
    note [Choosing loop breakers} above).

    A normal "strong" loop breaker has IAmLoopBreaker False.  So

                                Inline  postInlineUnconditionally
        IAmLoopBreaker False    no      no
        IAmLoopBreaker True     yes     no
        other                   yes     yes

    The **sole** reason for this kind of loop breaker is so that
    postInlineUnconditionally does not fire.  Ugh.  (Typically it'll
    inline via the usual callSiteInline stuff, so it'll be dead in the
    next pass, so the main Ugh is the tiresome complication.)

Note [Rules for imported functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this
   f = /\a. B.g a
   RULE B.g Int = 1 + f Int
Note that
  * The RULE is for an imported function.
  * f is non-recursive
Now we
can get
   f Int --> B.g Int      Inlining f
         --> 1 + f Int    Firing RULE
and so the simplifier goes into an infinite loop. This
would not happen if the RULE was for a local function,
because we keep track of dependencies through rules.  But
that is pretty much impossible to do for imported Ids.  Suppose
f's definition had been
   f = /\a. C.h a
where (by some long and devious process), C.h eventually inlines to
B.g.  We could only spot such loops by exhaustively following
unfoldings of C.h etc, in case we reach B.g, and hence (via the RULE)
f.

Note that RULES for imported functions are important in practice; they
occur a lot in the libraries.

We regard this potential infinite loop as a *programmer* error.
It's up the programmer not to write silly rules like
     RULE f x = f x
and the example above is just a more complicated version.

Note [Preventing loops due to imported functions rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider:
  import GHC.Base (foldr)

  {-# RULES "filterList" forall p. foldr (filterFB (:) p) [] = filter p #-}
  filter p xs = build (\c n -> foldr (filterFB c p) n xs)
  filterFB c p = ...

  f = filter p xs

Note that filter is not a loop-breaker, so what happens is:
  f =          filter p xs
    = {inline} build (\c n -> foldr (filterFB c p) n xs)
    = {inline} foldr (filterFB (:) p) [] xs
    = {RULE}   filter p xs

We are in an infinite loop.

A more elaborate example (that I actually saw in practice when I went to
mark GHC.List.filter as INLINABLE) is as follows. Say I have this module:
  {-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}
  module GHCList where

  import Prelude hiding (filter)
  import GHC.Base (build)

  {-# INLINABLE filter #-}
  filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
  filter p [] = []
  filter p (x:xs) = if p x then x : filter p xs else filter p xs

  {-# NOINLINE [0] filterFB #-}
  filterFB :: (a -> b -> b) -> (a -> Bool) -> a -> b -> b
  filterFB c p x r | p x       = x `c` r
                   | otherwise = r

  {-# RULES
  "filter"     [~1] forall p xs.  filter p xs = build (\c n -> foldr
  (filterFB c p) n xs)
  "filterList" [1]  forall p.     foldr (filterFB (:) p) [] = filter p
   #-}

Then (because RULES are applied inside INLINABLE unfoldings, but inlinings
are not), the unfolding given to "filter" in the interface file will be:
  filter p []     = []
  filter p (x:xs) = if p x then x : build (\c n -> foldr (filterFB c p) n xs)
                           else     build (\c n -> foldr (filterFB c p) n xs

Note that because this unfolding does not mention "filter", filter is not
marked as a strong loop breaker. Therefore at a use site in another module:
  filter p xs
    = {inline}
      case xs of []     -> []
                 (x:xs) -> if p x then x : build (\c n -> foldr (filterFB c p) n xs)
                                  else     build (\c n -> foldr (filterFB c p) n xs)

  build (\c n -> foldr (filterFB c p) n xs)
    = {inline} foldr (filterFB (:) p) [] xs
    = {RULE}   filter p xs

And we are in an infinite loop again, except that this time the loop is producing an
infinitely large *term* (an unrolling of filter) and so the simplifier finally
dies with "ticks exhausted"

Because of this problem, we make a small change in the occurrence analyser
designed to mark functions like "filter" as strong loop breakers on the basis that:
  1. The RHS of filter mentions the local function "filterFB"
  2. We have a rule which mentions "filterFB" on the LHS and "filter" on the RHS

So for each RULE for an *imported* function we are going to add
dependency edges between the *local* FVS of the rule LHS and the
*local* FVS of the rule RHS. We don't do anything special for RULES on
local functions because the standard occurrence analysis stuff is
pretty good at getting loop-breakerness correct there.

It is important to note that even with this extra hack we aren't always going to get
things right. For example, it might be that the rule LHS mentions an imported Id,
and another module has a RULE that can rewrite that imported Id to one of our local
Ids.

Note [Specialising imported functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BUT for *automatically-generated* rules, the programmer can't be
responsible for the "programmer error" in Note [Rules for imported
functions].  In particular, consider specialising a recursive function
defined in another module.  If we specialise a recursive function B.g,
we get
         g_spec = .....(B.g Int).....
         RULE B.g Int = g_spec
Here, g_spec doesn't look recursive, but when the rule fires, it
becomes so.  And if B.g was mutually recursive, the loop might
not be as obvious as it is here.

To avoid this,
 * When specialising a function that is a loop breaker,
   give a NOINLINE pragma to the specialised function

Note [Glomming]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RULES for imported Ids can make something at the top refer to something at the bottom:
        f = \x -> B.g (q x)
        h = \y -> 3

        RULE:  B.g (q x) = h x

Applying this rule makes f refer to h, although f doesn't appear to
depend on h.  (And, as in Note [Rules for imported functions], the
dependency might be more indirect. For example, f might mention C.t
rather than B.g, where C.t eventually inlines to B.g.)

NOTICE that this cannot happen for rules whose head is a
locally-defined function, because we accurately track dependencies
through RULES.  It only happens for rules whose head is an imported
function (B.g in the example above).

Solution:
  - When simplifying, bring all top level identifiers into
    scope at the start, ignoring the Rec/NonRec structure, so
    that when 'h' pops up in f's rhs, we find it in the in-scope set
    (as the simplifier generally expects). This happens in simplTopBinds.

  - In the occurrence analyser, if there are any out-of-scope
    occurrences that pop out of the top, which will happen after
    firing the rule:      f = \x -> h x
                          h = \y -> 3
    then just glom all the bindings into a single Rec, so that
    the *next* iteration of the occurrence analyser will sort
    them all out.   This part happens in occurAnalysePgm.

------------------------------------------------------------
Note [Inline rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
None of the above stuff about RULES applies to Inline Rules,
stored in a CoreUnfolding.  The unfolding, if any, is simplified
at the same time as the regular RHS of the function (ie *not* like
Note [Rules are visible in their own rec group]), so it should be
treated *exactly* like an extra RHS.

Or, rather, when computing loop-breaker edges,
  * If f has an INLINE pragma, and it is active, we treat the
    INLINE rhs as f's rhs
  * If it's inactive, we treat f as having no rhs
  * If it has no INLINE pragma, we look at f's actual rhs


There is a danger that we'll be sub-optimal if we see this
     f = ...f...
     [INLINE f = ..no f...]
where f is recursive, but the INLINE is not. This can just about
happen with a sufficiently odd set of rules; eg

        foo :: Int -> Int
        {-# INLINE [1] foo #-}
        foo x = x+1

        bar :: Int -> Int
        {-# INLINE [1] bar #-}
        bar x = foo x + 1

        {-# RULES "foo" [~1] forall x. foo x = bar x #-}

Here the RULE makes bar recursive; but it's INLINE pragma remains
non-recursive. It's tempting to then say that 'bar' should not be
a loop breaker, but an attempt to do so goes wrong in two ways:
   a) We may get
         $df = ...$cfoo...
         $cfoo = ...$df....
         [INLINE $cfoo = ...no-$df...]
      But we want $cfoo to depend on $df explicitly so that we
      put the bindings in the right order to inline $df in $cfoo
      and perhaps break the loop altogether.  (Maybe this
   b)


Example [eftInt]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example (from GHC.Enum):

  eftInt :: Int# -> Int# -> [Int]
  eftInt x y = ...(non-recursive)...

  {-# INLINE [0] eftIntFB #-}
  eftIntFB :: (Int -> r -> r) -> r -> Int# -> Int# -> r
  eftIntFB c n x y = ...(non-recursive)...

  {-# RULES
  "eftInt"  [~1] forall x y. eftInt x y = build (\ c n -> eftIntFB c n x y)
  "eftIntList"  [1] eftIntFB  (:) [] = eftInt
   #-}

Note [Specialisation rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider this group, which is typical of what SpecConstr builds:

   fs a = ....f (C a)....
   f  x = ....f (C a)....
   {-# RULE f (C a) = fs a #-}

So 'f' and 'fs' are in the same Rec group (since f refers to fs via its RULE).

But watch out!  If 'fs' is not chosen as a loop breaker, we may get an infinite loop:
  - the RULE is applied in f's RHS (see Note [Self-recursive rules] in Simplify
  - fs is inlined (say it's small)
  - now there's another opportunity to apply the RULE

This showed up when compiling Control.Concurrent.Chan.getChanContents.

{-
@loopBreakSCC@ is applied to the list of (binder,rhs) pairs for a cyclic
strongly connected component (there's guaranteed to be a cycle).  It returns the
same pairs, but
        a) in a better order,
        b) with some of the Ids having a IAmALoopBreaker pragma

The "loop-breaker" Ids are sufficient to break all cycles in the SCC.  This means
that the simplifier can guarantee not to loop provided it never records an inlining
for these no-inline guys.

Furthermore, the order of the binds is such that if we neglect dependencies
on the no-inline Ids then the binds are topologically sorted.  This means
that the simplifier will generally do a good job if it works from top bottom,
recording inlinings for any Ids which aren't marked as "no-inline" as it goes.

Note [Complexity of loop breaking]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The loop-breaking algorithm knocks out one binder at a time, and
performs a new SCC analysis on the remaining binders.  That can
behave very badly in tightly-coupled groups of bindings; in the
worst case it can be (N**2)*log N, because it does a full SCC
on N, then N-1, then N-2 and so on.

To avoid this, we switch plans after 2 (or whatever) attempts:
  Plan A: pick one binder with the lowest score, make it
          a loop breaker, and try again
  Plan B: pick *all* binders with the lowest score, make them
          all loop breakers, and try again
Since there are only a small finite number of scores, this will
terminate in a constant number of iterations, rather than O(N)
iterations.

You might thing that it's very unlikely, but RULES make it much
more likely.  Here's a real example from Trac #1969:
  Rec { $dm = \d.\x. op d
        {-# RULES forall d. $dm Int d  = $s$dm1
                  forall d. $dm Bool d = $s$dm2 #-}

        dInt = MkD .... opInt ...
        dInt = MkD .... opBool ...
        opInt  = $dm dInt
        opBool = $dm dBool

        $s$dm1 = \x. op dInt
        $s$dm2 = \x. op dBool }
The RULES stuff means that we can't choose $dm as a loop breaker
(Note [Choosing loop breakers]), so we must choose at least (say)
opInt *and* opBool, and so on.  The number of loop breakders is
linear in the number of instance declarations.

Note [Loop breakers and INLINE/INLINEABLE pragmas]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Avoid choosing a function with an INLINE pramga as the loop breaker!
If such a function is mutually-recursive with a non-INLINE thing,
then the latter should be the loop-breaker.

It's vital to distinguish between INLINE and INLINEABLE (the
Bool returned by hasStableCoreUnfolding_maybe).  If we start with
   Rec { {-# INLINEABLE f #-}
         f x = ...f... }
and then worker/wrapper it through strictness analysis, we'll get
   Rec { {-# INLINEABLE $wf #-}
         $wf p q = let x = (p,q) in ...f...

         {-# INLINE f #-}
         f x = case x of (p,q) -> $wf p q }

Now it is vital that we choose $wf as the loop breaker, so we can
inline 'f' in '$wf'.

Note [DFuns should not be loop breakers]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's particularly bad to make a DFun into a loop breaker.  See
Note [How instance declarations are translated] in TcInstDcls

We give DFuns a higher score than ordinary CONLIKE things because
if there's a choice we want the DFun to be the non-looop breker. Eg

rec { sc = /\ a \$dC. $fBWrap (T a) ($fCT @ a $dC)

      $fCT :: forall a_afE. (Roman.C a_afE) => Roman.C (Roman.T a_afE)
      {-# DFUN #-}
      $fCT = /\a \$dC. MkD (T a) ((sc @ a $dC) |> blah) ($ctoF @ a $dC)
    }

Here 'sc' (the superclass) looks CONLIKE, but we'll never get to it
if we can't unravel the DFun first.

Note [Constructor applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's really really important to inline dictionaries.  Real
example (the Enum Ordering instance from GHC.Base):

     rec     f = \ x -> case d of (p,q,r) -> p x
             g = \ x -> case d of (p,q,r) -> q x
             d = (v, f, g)

Here, f and g occur just once; but we can't inline them into d.
On the other hand we *could* simplify those case expressions if
we didn't stupidly choose d as the loop breaker.
But we won't because constructor args are marked "Many".
Inlining dictionaries is really essential to unravelling
the loops in static numeric dictionaries, see GHC.Float.

Note [Closure conversion]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We treat (\x. C p q) as a high-score candidate in the letrec scoring algorithm.
The immediate motivation came from the result of a closure-conversion transformation
which generated code like this:

    data Clo a b = forall c. Clo (c -> a -> b) c

    ($:) :: Clo a b -> a -> b
    Clo f env $: x = f env x

    rec { plus = Clo plus1 ()

        ; plus1 _ n = Clo plus2 n

        ; plus2 Zero     n = n
        ; plus2 (Succ m) n = Succ (plus $: m $: n) }

If we inline 'plus' and 'plus1', everything unravels nicely.  But if
we choose 'plus1' as the loop breaker (which is entirely possible
otherwise), the loop does not unravel nicely.


@occAnalRhs@ deals with the question of bindings where the Id is marked
by an INLINE pragma.  For these we record that anything which occurs
in its RHS occurs many times.  This pessimistically assumes that ths
inlined binder also occurs many times in its scope, but if it doesn't
we'll catch it next time round.  At worst this costs an extra simplifier pass.
ToDo: try using the occurrence info for the inline'd binder.

[March 97] We do the same for atomic RHSs.  Reason: see notes with loopBreakSCC.
[June 98, SLPJ]  I've undone this change; I don't understand it.  See notes with loopBreakSCC.

{-
Note [Cascading inlines]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default we use an rhsCtxt for the RHS of a binding.  This tells the
occ anal n that it's looking at an RHS, which has an effect in
occAnalApp.  In particular, for constructor applications, it makes
the arguments appear to have NoOccInfo, so that we don't inline into
them. Thus    x = f y
              k = Just x
we do not want to inline x.

But there's a problem.  Consider
     x1 = a0 : []
     x2 = a1 : x1
     x3 = a2 : x2
     g  = f x3
First time round, it looks as if x1 and x2 occur as an arg of a
let-bound constructor ==> give them a many-occurrence.
But then x3 is inlined (unconditionally as it happens) and
next time round, x2 will be, and the next time round x1 will be
Result: multiple simplifier iterations.  Sigh.

So, when analysing the RHS of x3 we notice that x3 will itself
definitely inline the next time round, and so we analyse x3's rhs in
an ordinary context, not rhsCtxt.  Hence the "certainly_inline" stuff.

Annoyingly, we have to approximate SimplUtils.preInlineUnconditionally.
If we say "yes" when preInlineUnconditionally says "no" the simplifier iterates
indefinitely:
        x = f y
        k = Just x
inline ==>
        k = Just (f y)
float ==>
        x1 = f y
        k = Just x1

This is worse than the slow cascade, so we only want to say "certainly_inline"
if it really is certain.  Look at the note with preInlineUnconditionally
for the various clauses.

Note [Use one-shot information]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The occurrence analyser propagates one-shot-lambda information in two situation
  * Applications:  eg   build (\cn -> blah)
    Propagate one-shot info from the strictness signature of 'build' to
    the \cn

  * Let-bindings:  eg   let f = \c. let ... in \n -> blah
                        in (build f, build f)
    Propagate one-shot info from the demanand-info on 'f' to the
    lambdas in its RHS (which may not be syntactically at the top)

Some of this is done by the demand analyser, but this way it happens
much earlier, taking advantage of the strictness signature of
imported functions.

Note [Binders in case alternatives]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
    case x of y { (a,b) -> f y }
We treat 'a', 'b' as dead, because they don't physically occur in the
case alternative.  (Indeed, a variable is dead iff it doesn't occur in
its scope in the output of OccAnal.)  It really helps to know when
binders are unused.  See esp the call to isDeadBinder in
Simplify.mkDupableAlt

In this example, though, the Simplifier will bring 'a' and 'b' back to
life, because it binds 'y' to (a,b) (imagine got inlined and
scrutinised y).

Note [Binder swap]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We do these two transformations right here:

 (1)   case x of b { pi -> ri }
    ==>
      case x of b { pi -> let x=b in ri }

 (2)  case (x |> co) of b { pi -> ri }
    ==>
      case (x |> co) of b { pi -> let x = b |> sym co in ri }

    Why (2)?  See Note [Case of cast]

In both cases, in a particular alternative (pi -> ri), we only
add the binding if
  (a) x occurs free in (pi -> ri)
        (ie it occurs in ri, but is not bound in pi)
  (b) the pi does not bind b (or the free vars of co)
We need (a) and (b) for the inserted binding to be correct.

For the alternatives where we inject the binding, we can transfer
all x's OccInfo to b.  And that is the point.

Notice that
  * The deliberate shadowing of 'x'.
  * That (a) rapidly becomes false, so no bindings are injected.

The reason for doing these transformations here is because it allows
us to adjust the OccInfo for 'x' and 'b' as we go.

  * Suppose the only occurrences of 'x' are the scrutinee and in the
    ri; then this transformation makes it occur just once, and hence
    get inlined right away.

  * If we do this in the Simplifier, we don't know whether 'x' is used
    in ri, so we are forced to pessimistically zap b's OccInfo even
    though it is typically dead (ie neither it nor x appear in the
    ri).  There's nothing actually wrong with zapping it, except that
    it's kind of nice to know which variables are dead.  My nose
    tells me to keep this information as robustly as possible.

The Maybe (Id,CoreExpr) passed to occAnalAlt is the extra let-binding
{x=b}; it's Nothing if the binder-swap doesn't happen.

There is a danger though.  Consider
      let v = x +# y
      in case (f v) of w -> ...v...v...
And suppose that (f v) expands to just v.  Then we'd like to
use 'w' instead of 'v' in the alternative.  But it may be too
late; we may have substituted the (cheap) x+#y for v in the
same simplifier pass that reduced (f v) to v.

I think this is just too bad.  CSE will recover some of it.

Note [Case of cast]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider        case (x `cast` co) of b { I# ->
                ... (case (x `cast` co) of {...}) ...
We'd like to eliminate the inner case.  That is the motivation for
equation (2) in Note [Binder swap].  When we get to the inner case, we
inline x, cancel the casts, and away we go.

Note [Binder swap on GlobalId scrutinees]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the scrutinee is a GlobalId we must take care in two ways

 i) In order to *know* whether 'x' occurs free in the RHS, we need its
    occurrence info. BUT, we don't gather occurrence info for
    GlobalIds.  That's the reason for the (small) occ_gbl_scrut env in
    OccEnv is for: it says "gather occurrence info for these".

 ii) We must call localiseId on 'x' first, in case it's a GlobalId, or
     has an External Name. See, for example, SimplEnv Note [Global Ids in
     the substitution].

Note [Zap case binders in proxy bindings]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From the original
     case x of cb(dead) { p -> ...x... }
we will get
     case x of cb(live) { p -> let x = cb in ...x... }

Core Lint never expects to find an *occurrence* of an Id marked
as Dead, so we must zap the OccInfo on cb before making the
binding x = cb.  See Trac #5028.

Historical note [no-case-of-case]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We *used* to suppress the binder-swap in case expressions when
-fno-case-of-case is on.  Old remarks:
    "This happens in the first simplifier pass,
    and enhances full laziness.  Here's the bad case:
            f = \ y -> ...(case x of I# v -> ...(case x of ...) ... )
    If we eliminate the inner case, we trap it inside the I# v -> arm,
    which might prevent some full laziness happening.  I've seen this
    in action in spectral/cichelli/Prog.hs:
             [(m,n) | m <- [1..max], n <- [1..max]]
    Hence the check for NoCaseOfCase."
However, now the full-laziness pass itself reverses the binder-swap, so this
check is no longer necessary.

Historical note [Suppressing the case binder-swap]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This old note describes a problem that is also fixed by doing the
binder-swap in OccAnal:

    There is another situation when it might make sense to suppress the
    case-expression binde-swap. If we have

        case x of w1 { DEFAULT -> case x of w2 { A -> e1; B -> e2 }
                       ...other cases .... }

    We'll perform the binder-swap for the outer case, giving

        case x of w1 { DEFAULT -> case w1 of w2 { A -> e1; B -> e2 }
                       ...other cases .... }

    But there is no point in doing it for the inner case, because w1 can't
    be inlined anyway.  Furthermore, doing the case-swapping involves
    zapping w2's occurrence info (see paragraphs that follow), and that
    forces us to bind w2 when doing case merging.  So we get

        case x of w1 { A -> let w2 = w1 in e1
                       B -> let w2 = w1 in e2
                       ...other cases .... }

    This is plain silly in the common case where w2 is dead.

    Even so, I can't see a good way to implement this idea.  I tried
    not doing the binder-swap if the scrutinee was already evaluated
    but that failed big-time:

            data T = MkT !Int

            case v of w  { MkT x ->
            case x of x1 { I# y1 ->
            case x of x2 { I# y2 -> ...

    Notice that because MkT is strict, x is marked "evaluated".  But to
    eliminate the last case, we must either make sure that x (as well as
    x1) has unfolding MkT y1.  The straightforward thing to do is to do
    the binder-swap.  So this whole note is a no-op.

It's fixed by doing the binder-swap in OccAnal because we can do the
binder-swap unconditionally and still get occurrence analysis
information right.
