# Overview

## Objectives

- You will learn how to setup a simple web application.

## Servant

We will be using the [Servant](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) web framework to demonstrate how to write web applications in Eta.


Servant uses the powerful strong typing features of Eta to provide a type-safe DSL that allows you to write web applications and services in a rock-solid way.


Note that Servant is a Haskell web framework. Because of the [eta-hackage](https://github.com/typelead/eta-hackage) patching layer, the framework has been patched to work with Eta.

## Type-Level Programming

The Servant framework makes heavy use of type-level programming, which can be thought of as a type-safe, composeable, extensible macro system in Eta. Using the framework does not require a deep understanding of type-level programming.

## Next Section

We will learn the basics of the framework in the next section.
