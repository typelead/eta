# What is the Eta REPL?

## Overview

The Eta REPL allows you to interactively write programs and see the live results. REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop.

* Read - reads the expression you type in the prompt
* Eval - evaluates the given expression
* Print - prints the result of the evaluation
* Loop - loops back to the *Read* step

The Eta REPL is based on Haskell's [GHCi](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.4.1/docs/html/users_guide/ghci.htm) with several usability differences.

## Motivation

Interacting with your programs in realtime is a great way to quickly solidfy your understanding of how your application is pieced together and also quickly learn about how new libraries work.
