## Windows

On Windows, you have two options:

    1. [Enable WSL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/install_guide).
    2. Enter the root folder of WSL, and create a `.local` folder, and then inside of this create a `bin` folder.
    3. Follow the instructions for Ubuntu above to setup your environment.
    4. Proceed to source installation instructions below.

2.  [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/index.html) & [MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS)

    1. [Install Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html).
    2. [Install MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS).
    3. Proceed to source installation instructions below.

## Installation

You have two options for installing:

- The `stable` branch which contains the last version that had a binary release

```sh
$ git clone --branch stable --recursive --depth 1 https://github.com/typelead/eta
$ cd eta
```

- The `master` branch which has the latest version of Eta.

```sh
$ git clone --recursive --depth 1 https://github.com/typelead/eta
$ cd eta
```

Below are the OS-specific installation instructions:

**Linux/OS X**

```sh
$ ./install.sh
```

**Windows**

```sh
$ install.cmd
```

If you omit the `--recursive` flag to `git clone`, you will need to initialize the projectâ€™s submodules before installing:

```sh
$ git submodule sync
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Once the installation is done, you will now have access to the following command-line tools:

- `eta` - The main compiler
- `etlas` - The package manager and build tool

Check to ensure that they are on the `PATH`.

```sh
$ eta --version
$ etlas --version
```

If you obtain an error that either tool is missing, run the following command:

```sh
$ stack path --local-bin
```

Add the path that you obtain in the output to your `PATH` environment variable.

## Updating Eta

If you want to update your source installation, you can follow the steps below.

### Existing Clone

If you already have an existing clone of the repository, you can run the command below:

**Linux/OS X**

```sh
$ ./update.sh
```

**Windows**

```sh
$ update.cmd
```

### Fresh Clone

If you want to do a fresh clone, you can run the steps below:

```sh
$ git clone --recursive --depth 1 https://github.com/typelead/eta
$ cd eta
```

**Linux/OS X**

```sh
$ ./cleaninstall.sh
```

**Windows**

```sh
$ cleaninstall.cmd
```
